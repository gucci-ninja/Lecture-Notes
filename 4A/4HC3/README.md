## Day 1 - Sept 4, 2019
- interface
    - between 2 faces
    - not the skin of the application
- interaction
    - dynamic
- task based inteface design
    - what does the user need
- book: The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman

### Communication
- interaction is about communication
- simple information is harder to display since there is an expectatin to understand the information easily
- should design intuitively
- need to communicate to user what things they can do

#### Exercises
- chapter 1-6
- good to say that you know design thinking :hushed:
- default project: go find a user who has problems with math

### Elm
- compiles into javascript
- fully functional
- safe

### Design Thinking
- double diamond (insert diagram)
- there are 2 different kind of processes
- need a divergent phase where we generate different ideas
- some people like coming up with multiple ways of doing something and others want to find one right way
- it's good to be in a team that has both of the above
- need to research 
- understand things in others POV (empathy)
