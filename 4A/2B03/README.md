*2 mathematical equations will be mentioned in the course*

### Pictures

#### *meteor shower*
- dust burning up in the sky
- as earth passes through a section of space with dust from a comet in the past, the atmostphere burns the dust.

#### *aurora (northern light)*
- wind from the sun
- north pole moving away from canada

#### *milky way*
- galaxy where we are in
- dark parts between stars is dust blocking the light

#### *saturn*
- Gas Giant
- largest rings in the solar system

#### *jupiter*
- Gas Giant
- Great red spot is a storm (hurricane)
- Juno Probe took a photo of the pole

#### *remnent of a supernova (1987A)*
- death of a star (high mass)
- not part of our galaxy

#### *butterfly nebula*
- death of a star (low mass)

#### *cat's eye nebula*
- another example

#### *eagle nebula*
- infrared is absorbed less than visible light by space dust

#### *group of galaxy*
- can affect other galaxy, merge, etc

#### *galaxy cluster*
- so much gravity that bend's light
- light behind galaxy cluster is stretched out

#### *XDF*
- long exposure of a Hubble Telescope
- many galaxies.

## Lecture 1
universe heirarchy of scale and sizes (small to large):
- Planet
- Stars
- Galaxies
- Universe as a whole

### Scalings
- if the Earth is a basketball, moon would be a tennisball in size

- How many earths would fit in the Sun?
    - about a million
- How many jupitors would fit in the Sun?
    - about 900
- How many moons would fit in the Earth?
    - about 50

- if the distance between Earth and the Sun is represented by the distance to Toronto from Hamilton?
    - Hamilton to Mexico or Calgary
    - around 40 times longer 
    - distance from Sun and Earth is called **AU**
    - distance to moon:
        - small part of a street
    - size of Earch:
        - size of great white shark
    - distance to next nearest star:
        - 25 round trip to the moon

### Objects in Space
#### Earth
- Both land + water
- Atmosphere
- Cloud + weather
- Temperature range

#### Moon
- only natural satellite
- Rocky, **ancient surface**
    - surface doesn't change
- airless
- geologically dead
    - no volcanic activity
- huge temperature range

#### Mars
- **Old surface**
- polar ice caps
    - little water ice
- liquid water occurs certain times
- thin atmosphere
- may be habitable

#### Terrestrial planets
- first 4 planets
- rocky surface
- relatively similar in size
