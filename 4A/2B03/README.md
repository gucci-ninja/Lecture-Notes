_2 mathematical equations will be mentioned in the course_

### Pictures

#### _meteor shower_

- dust burning up in the sky
- as earth passes through a section of space with dust from a comet in the past, the atmostphere burns the dust.

#### _aurora (northern light)_

- wind from the sun
- north pole moving away from canada

#### _milky way_

- galaxy where we are in
- dark parts between stars is dust blocking the light

#### _saturn_

- Gas Giant
- largest rings in the solar system

#### _jupiter_

- Gas Giant
- Great red spot is a storm (hurricane)
- Juno Probe took a photo of the pole

#### _remnent of a supernova (1987A)_

- death of a star (high mass)
- not part of our galaxy

#### _butterfly nebula_

- death of a star (low mass)

#### _cat's eye nebula_

- another example

#### _eagle nebula_

- infrared is absorbed less than visible light by space dust

#### _group of galaxy_

- can affect other galaxy, merge, etc

#### _galaxy cluster_

- so much gravity that bend's light
- light behind galaxy cluster is stretched out

#### _XDF_

- long exposure of a Hubble Telescope
- many galaxies.

## Lecture 2

universe heirarchy of scale and sizes (small to large):

- Planet
- Stars
- Galaxies
- Universe as a whole

### Scalings

- if the Earth is a basketball, moon would be a tennisball in size

- How many earths would fit in the Sun?
  - about a million
- How many jupitors would fit in the Sun?
  - about 900
- How many moons would fit in the Earth?

  - about 50

- if the distance between Earth and the Sun is represented by the distance to Toronto from Hamilton?
  - Hamilton to Mexico or Calgary
  - around 40 times longer
  - distance from Sun and Earth is called **AU**
  - distance to moon:
    - small part of a street
  - size of Earch:
    - size of great white shark
  - distance to next nearest star:
    - 25 round trip to the moon

### Objects in Space

#### Earth

- Both land + water
- Atmosphere
- Cloud + weather
- Temperature range

#### Moon

- only natural satellite
- Rocky, **ancient surface**
  - surface doesn't change
- airless
- geologically dead
  - no volcanic activity
- huge temperature range

#### Mars

- **Old surface**
- polar ice caps
  - little water ice
- liquid water occurs certain times
- thin atmosphere
- may be habitable

#### Terrestrial planets

- first 4 planets
- rocky surface
- relatively similar in size

## Lecture 3

Quiz is embedded in videos.(5%)

### Quiz 1

**Why does Moon have more craters on its surface than the Earth**

- No geologic activity or weathering on the Moon

**The distance between the Sun and Earth is smaller than the distance between the MilkyWay and Andromada by approximately how much?**

- 1 million (AU)

- first four planets are Terrestrial planets
- outer 4 planets are Gas Giants

### Jupiter

- Jupiter has 79 moons that we have found
- largest gas giant in the solar system
- can have northern lights
- four biggest moons are galilain moon
  - found by galilao
  - as large as terrestrial planets
  - Europa (2nd)
    - believed to have liquid water beneath ice layer
  - can be seen in modest binoculors
- can be seen with a naked eye

### Saturn

- Saturn has multiple moons
- largest rings in the solar system
  - rings are very thin
- cassini took closest photo
- can be seen with a naked eye

### Uranus and Neptune

- two farthest away
- 30 AU
- both blue

### Space between Planets

- Kuiper Belt
  - icy
  - very small
  - found beyond Neptune
- Aestroid belt
  - between Mars and Jupiter
- Drawf Planets can be found in the belts
