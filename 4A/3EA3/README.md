## Segment 0
programs are:
- commands to a computer
    - execution
- mathematical expressions
    - theory of programming

why theory?
- proof, calculation, precision, understanding
- theory = formalism + rules of proof, calculation, manipulation

formal != careful, detailed
formal = formulas (mathematical expressions)

informal != sloppy, sketchy
informal = using natural language (English)

Project:
- always starts informal (with discussion)
- always ends formal (with program)

testing:
how do you know if program if working
what about the inputs you didn't test

proof tells whether program is correct for all inputs

program development, with proof at each step
program modification, with proof

### Other Theories
Hoare triples
- first
Model checking
- used the most in industry
- exhaustive automated testing
- up to 10^60 states ~~ 2^200 states = 200 bits ~~ 6 variables
    - not very special
- abstraction, proof if state space is too large

### Our Theory
- simplier
    - just binary (boolean) expressions
- more general
    - includes terminating and nonterminating computation
    - includes sequential and parallel computation
    - inclues stand-alone and interactive computation
    - inclues time and space bounds and real time
    - includes probabilistic computations
- prerequisite
    - language with assignment and if statement
