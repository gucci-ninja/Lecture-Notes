# 4E03 Performance Analysis of Computer Systems

## Day 1 - Sept 4, 2019
- weekly assignments (11 in total) 
- mark is based on best 5 assignments
- assignments will come out on mondays and TAs will do questions related to the assigment
- key points when talking about performance 
    - how long it takes to do something (response time -> computation time + waiting time)
    - reliability
    - energy consumption
- performance metrics
    - when talking about response time, some metrics we can use is the average, maximum but we can als say like 95% of the time your response time will be less than x
    - for reliability, we can use a percentage for uptime but that doesn't tell you if the system is down for long priods a a time or short
    - energy consumption measures ??
- other factors for performance
    - workloads - how do computer systems work under certain work loads
        - how often to requests arrive (arrival patterns/times)
    - failures
    - user behaviour 
        - eg google's page ranking agorithm uses user behaviour statistics
