## Segment 0

programs are:

- commands to a computer
  - execution
- mathematical expressions
  - theory of programming

why theory?

- proof, calculation, precision, understanding
- theory = formalism + rules of proof, calculation, manipulation

formal != careful, detailed
formal = formulas (mathematical expressions)

informal != sloppy, sketchy
informal = using natural language (English)

Project:

- always starts informal (with discussion)
- always ends formal (with program)

testing:
how do you know if program if working
what about the inputs you didn't test

proof tells whether program is correct for all inputs

program development, with proof at each step
program modification, with proof

### Other Theories

Hoare triples

- first
  Model checking
- used the most in industry
- exhaustive automated testing
- up to 10^60 states ~~ 2^200 states = 200 bits ~~ 6 variables
  - not very special
- abstraction, proof if state space is too large

### Our Theory

- simplier
  - just binary (boolean) expressions
- more general
  - includes terminating and nonterminating computation
  - includes sequential and parallel computation
  - inclues stand-alone and interactive computation
  - inclues time and space bounds and real time
  - includes probabilistic computations
- prerequisite
  - language with assignment and if statement

## Segment 1

### Introduction of math using in the course

- Binary Theory
  - binary expressions: represents anything that comes in two kinds
    - statements about the world
    - digital circuits
    - human behavior
  - theorems: represents one kind
    - representing true statements
    - circuits with low voltage
    - innocent behavior
  - antitheoem: represents teh other kind
    - representing false statemetns
    - circuits with high voltage
    - guilty behavior

### Operators

- 0 operands
  - **⊤** True (Top)
  - **⊥** False (Bottom)
- 1 operand
  - 4 operators exist
  - **¬** not (negation)
- 2 operands
  - 16 operators exist
  - **∧** and (conjucts)
    - gives the minimum of the two values
  - **∨** or (disjuncts)
    - gives the maximum of the two values
  - **⇒** implies (left is falser than or equal to right)
    - left is antecent
    - right is consequent
  - **⇐** implied by (left is truer or equal to right)
    - left is consequent
    - right is antecent
  - **=** equals
  - **⧧** unequal (xor)
- 3 operands
  - 256 operators
  - **if then else fi** conditional operation
- precedence and parenthese
- associative operators: ∧, ∨, =, ⧧
  - x ∨ y ∨ z means **(x ∨ y) ∨ z** or **x ∨ (y ∨ z)**
- continuing operators: ⇒, ⇐, =, ⧧
  - x = y = z means **x = y** ∧ **y = z**
  - x ⇒ y ⇒ z means (x ⇒ y) ∧ (y ⇒ z)
    - = takes precedence over ∧ but ⇒ does not
- big operator
  - same as regular operator but later precedence
  - written to be bigger than regular counterpart

### Truth Tables

- ⊤ represents an entire theorem
- ⊥ represents an entire antitheorem

#### 1 operand

| --  | ⊤   | ⊥   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ¬   | ⊥   | ⊤   |

#### 2 operands

| --  | ⊤⊤  | ⊤⊥  | ⊥⊤  | ⊥⊥  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ∧   | ⊤   | ⊥   | ⊥   | ⊥   |
| ∨   | ⊤   | ⊤   | ⊤   | ⊥   |
| ⇒   | ⊤   | ⊥   | ⊤   | ⊤   |
| ⇐   | ⊤   | ⊤   | ⊥   | ⊤   |
| =   | ⊤   | ⊥   | ⊥   | ⊤   |
| ⧧   | ⊥   | ⊤   | ⊤   | ⊥   |

#### 3 operands

| --              | ⊤⊤⊤ | ⊤⊤⊥ | ⊤⊥⊤ | ⊤⊥⊥ | ⊥⊤⊤ | ⊥⊤⊥ | ⊥⊥⊤ | ⊥⊥⊥ |
| --------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| if then else fi | ⊤   | ⊤   | ⊥   | ⊥   | ⊤   | ⊥   | ⊤   | ⊥   |

### Variables

- used for substitution(instantiation)
- add parenthses to maintain precedence
  - x ∧ y
  - x = ⊤
  - y = ⊤ ∧ ⊥
  - x ∧ y = ⊤ ∧ (**⊤ ∧ ⊥**)

### new binary expressions

- applications will supply its own binary expression

  - (the grass is green)
  - 1 + 1 = 2

- consistent: no binary expression is both a theorem and antitheorem
  - (no overclassified expression)
  - required
- complete: every binary expression is either a theorem or antitheorem
  - (no unclassified expression)
  - not required

### Proving

- deciding whether a binary expression is a theorem or antitheorem
- simplifying to True
- **Axiom Rule**

  - if a binary expression is an axiom, then it is a theorem
  - if a binary expression is an antiaxiom, then it is an antitheorem
  - example
    - parallel lines never meet
      - this isn't true in every form of mathematics
      - made into an axiom so it represents the truth
  - axioms describe the rules of the world that it is in
    - x + y = y + x
      - represents truth in an application where order of adding does not affect end quantity
      - is a axiom
      - is a theorem
      - is equivalent to ⊤
    - axiom: ⊤
    - antiaxiom: ⊥
    - axiom: (the grass is green)
    - antiaxiom: (the sky is green)
    - axiom: (intelligent messages are coming from space) implies (there is life elsewhere in the universe)

- **Evaluation Rule**

  - if all the binary subexpressions of a binary expression are classified, the binary expression is classified using the truth table
    - x ∨ y
    - x = ⊤
    - y = ⊥
    - x ∨ y is a theorem as ⊤ or ⊤ = ⊤

- **Completion Rule**

  - if a binary expression contains unclassified binary subexpressions, and all ways of classifying them place it in the same class, it is in that class
    - x ∨ ⊤
      - can only be a theorem despite one subexpression (x) not known

- **Consistency Rule**

  - if a classified binary expression contains binary subexpressions and there is only one consistent way to classify them, they are classified that way
    - x = ⊤
    - x ⇒ y = ⊤
    - y = ⊤ as
      - if y = ⊥, then x ⇒ y = ⊥.
      - That would be **inconsistent**.

- **Instance Rule**

  - if a binary expression is classified as a theorem or antitheorem
    - all its instances have that same classification
    - axiom: x=x
    - theorem: x=x
    - theorem: (⊤ = (⊥ ∨ ⊥)) = (⊤ = (⊥ ∨ ⊥))

- **Classical Logic**: using all 5 rules
- **Constructive Logic**: not using Completion Rule
- **Evaluation Logic**: not using the Completion Rule nor Consistency Rule

### Formatting

- space subexpressions with less precedence bigger
  - a∧b ∨ c
- newline at main connective
- brackets should start and end at the same line as a subexpression
- continuing expression should have hints explaining why one expression is equal to the next expression

## Segment 2

### Monotonicity and Antimonotonicity

| Monotonicity                                               | Antimonotonicity                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| x &le; y ⇒ f(x) &le; f(y)                                  | x &le; y ⇒ f(x) &ge; f(y)                                  |
| x ⇒ y <span style="font-size:larger;">⇒</span> f(x) ⇒ f(y) | x ⇒ y <span style="font-size:larger;">⇒</span> f(x) ⇐ f(y) |

- for binary equations, instead of x &le; y, we use **x ⇒ y**
  - aka x is stronger than y
  - aka x is falser than y
- as x gets falser, f(x) goes falser (or equal)

| expression                            | description                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ¬ a                                   | antimonotonic in a                 |
| a ∧ b                                 | monotonic in a, monotonic in b     |
| a ∨ b                                 | monotonic in a, monotonic in b     |
| a ⇒ b                                 | antimonotinic in a, monotonic in b |
| a ⇐ b                                 | monotonic in a, antimonotinic in b |
| **if** a **then** b **else** c **fi** | monotonic in b, monotonic in c     |

- useful in proofs

### Context

- a and b are long expressions
- in a ∧ b, when changing a, we can assume b
- in b ∧ a, when changing b, we can assume a
  - if we are right in assumption, good
  - if we are wrong in assumption, answer is ⊥ by default

### Number Theory

- number expression represent quantity
- ∞ may be unfamiliar
- if a then x else y fi
  - a is binary, but x and y are number expressions

### Character Theory

- character written between ""
- left quote: """"
- right quot: """"

## Segment 3

### Collections

- 4 simplest data structures
  - defined by **packaging** and **indexing**

| --     | packaged | indexed |
| ------ | -------- | ------- |
| bunch  | ⊥        | ⊥       |
| set    | ⊤        | ⊥       |
| string | ⊥        | ⊤       |
| list   | ⊤        | ⊤       |

### Bunches

- can be used represent collections
  - simplest
  - no difference between an object and a bunch consisting of only that object
  - any number, character, binary or set is an **elementary bunch**, or **element**
  - operators
    - **,** union
    - **‘** intersection
    - **¢** size, cardinality(number)
      - repeat elements don't change size
        - ¢(1,2,3) = 3 = ¢(1,2,3,1)
    - **:** inclusion(binary)
      - ⊤ if all elements of left are elements of right (subset?)
        - 2:1,2,3 (2 is an element in 1,2,3)
      - acts like &le; and ⇒
- special bunches

| name    | elements                    | description               |
| ------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| _null_  |                             | empty bunch               |
| _bin_   | ⊤,⊥                         | binary values             |
| _nat_   | 0,1,2,...                   | natural numbers           |
| _int_   | ...,-1,0,1,...              | integers                  |
| _rat_   | ..., -1,0,1/2,...           | rational numbers          |
| _real_  | ..., 2<sup>1/2</sup>,...    | real numbers              |
| _xnat_  | 0,1,2,...,∞                 | extended natural numbers  |
| _xint_  | -∞,...,-1,0,1,...∞          | extended integers         |
| _xrat_  | -∞..., -1,0,1/2,... ∞       | extended rational numbers |
| _xreal_ | -∞..., 2<sup>1/2</sup>,...∞ | extended real numbers     |
| _char_  | ..., "a",..."A",...         | characters                |

- final notation
  - x,..y
    - x to y for x &le; y
  - i: x,..y = x &le; i < y
  - ¢(x,..y) = y-x
- distribution
  - -(1,2,3) = -1, -2, -3
  - (1,2) + (10,20) = 11,12,21,22
  - (1,2) + 10 = 11,12
  - 1 + 10 = 11
  - null + 10 = null
  - ¢ of sum of two bunch is at most the × of ¢ of both bunch

### Set Theory

- operators
  - **{A}** set formation operator
    - performed on a bunch
    - {_null_} empty set (informal)
  - **~S** contents of S
    - undos a set into a bunch
    - ~{1,2,3} = 1,2,3
  - **\$** size cardinality
  - **ϟ** returns a bunch containing power set
    - ϟ{1,2} = {null}, {1}, {2}, {1,2}

## Segment 4

### String Theory

- indexed sequences
- any object is a one item string
- operator
  - _nil_ is empty string
  - **;** join
  - **↔** string length
    - can be placed on string measure ruler
    - indexes go between letters
  - **(S)<sub>i</sub>** is the ith index of string S
    - 0 indexed
    - at index **n**
      - the number of items processed is n
      - next item is item n
    - if i is a string, we get a string of results
      - (0;1;2;3;4;5)<sub>3;5</sub> = 3;5
  - **\*** is a repetition operator
    - 3\*(4;2) = 4;2;4;2;4;2
    - if left is empty, means any number of repititions
      - \*2 = _nil_, 2, 2;2, ...
  - **⊲ i ⊳** modification operator
    - change left element at i to right string
- special ordering of strings
  - lexicographical order
  - 3;6;4;1 < 3;7;12
  - 3;6;4 < 3;6;4;1
  - x;..y means **x to y** for x &le; y
  - ↔(x;..y) = y-x
  - (x;..y) ; (y;..z) = x;..z
- string joins distributes over bunch unions
  - string of bunches = bunch of strings

#### Text

- text is displayed within **""**
  - """Hello"", said Sushi"
  - double quotes require repeated "" within the text
  - can also join all the characters with separate text
- can perform string operators
  - takng an index of string with a string becomes a subtext
    - "01234"<sub>2;..4</sub> = "23"

#### Zero

- invented after
  - natural numbers
  - negative numbers
  - rational numbers
  - irrational numbers
- widely used arouind 1000 years ago
- still not used very well
  - "there are **a number** of things to discuss"
    - meaning non-zero
  - taxes and other documentations sometimes requires writing _nil_ instead of 0
  - keyboards and telephones have zero after 9
  - Time differences sometimes have **N/A** or **0** instead of 0
    - or they have to explain zero
- Measuring must start at 0. Counting is measuring
  - octave is an interval of 8, 2 octaves is an interval of 15
    - it starts counting at 1 so its always off by 1
  - AD started counting at year 1, so the difference between year after AD and before BC is off by 1
  - Fortran 1955 loop requires at least once
  - Pascal arrays must have at least 1 element
    - brought back data structure algebra
- first: preceding all others in time, order, importance
  - associated with 1 (1st)
- last: following all others in time, order, importance
- second: following first
- avoid third onwards as they are really associated with the number before

### Lists

- string in a package
  - not unlike set is a bunch in a package
- operators
  - **[A]** list formation operator
    - also distributes over union of bunches
      - list of bunches = bunch of lists
  - **~[A]** contents of a list
  - **#[A]** length of a list
  - **[A] i** index of a list
    - **[A] [i]** composition of a list
      - returns a new list with elements corresponding to list [i]
  - **[A] ;; [B]** join
  - elements of A followed by elements of B in a string
  - folows lexicographic order **<, >**
  - **i → e | [A]** modification
    - change ith element of A with e
    - 2 → 4 | [10;..15] = [10;11;4;13;14]
    - can have multiple modifications at once
      - done right to left
      - when modifying while referencing self, it is referencing pre-changes
      - Example
        - L = [10;..15]
        - 2 → L3 | 3 → L2 | L &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // technically referencing L, not itself
        - = 2 → 13 | 3 → 12 | [10;11;12;13;14] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // replace references with literal
        - = 2 → 13 | [10;11;12;12;14]
        - = [10;11;13;12;14]
- when indexing a list or string the returning object is equal to the object of the index

| Index                    | Result                                                                        |

| S<sub>n;m</sub>          | S<sub>n</sub>;S<sub>m</sub>                                                   |
| S<sub>[n;m]</sub>        | [S<sub>n</sub>;S<sub>m</sub>]                                                 |
| Ln,m                     | Ln,Lm                                                                         |
| L{n,m}                   | {Ln,Lm}                                                                       |
| L(n;m)                   | Ln;Lm                                                                         |
| L[n;m]                   | [Ln;Lm]                                                                       |
| ---                      | ---                                                                           |
| S<sub>0,{1,[2;1];0</sub> | S<sub>0</sub>, {S<sub>1</sub>, [S<sub>2</sub>; S<sub>1</sub>]; S<sub>0</sub>} |
| L(0,{1,[2;1];0)          | L0,{L1,[L2;L1];L0}                                                            |

#### Multidimensional structures

- Array is a multidimensional list
  - we want to index using list operators
  - A i j...
    - i will give content at index i (usually a list)
    - j will give content of i at index j
    - etc.
  - if A was 2 dimensions
    - i will give a list
    - j would give an element
  - if we use bunch notation
    - A (i,j) = A i, A j = 2 lists
    - A [i,j] = [A i, A j] = a new array

## Segment 5

### Functions

- **〈_v:D → b_〉**
  - "map *v* in *D* to *b*"
  - _v_ variable name
  - _D_ domain,type (a bunch)
  - _b_ body (may use *v*)
    - what is returned
  - _v:D_ is a local axiom within _b_
- operators
  - **〈〉** function scopes
    - renaming just requires equal to same function with different variable name
  - **☐** returns _D_ of function
  - **_f x_** function _f_ applied to _x_
    - f of x
    - can be (f) x or f (x) but in isolation, wouldn't matter
    - substitute _v_ in _f_ to _x_
  - **f|g** selective union of functions _f_ and _g_
    - ☐(f|g) = ☐ f, ☐ g
    - (f|g) x = if x: ☐ f then f x else g x fi
- 2 variable functions
  - f = 〈*x:D →* 〈*y:D → x &le; y*〉〉
  - f 3 = 〈*y:D → 3 &le; y*〉
  - f 3 5 = 3 &le; 5
  - f (3,5) = f 3, f 5
    - since function distributes over bunch
- predicate
  - function returns binary (⊤,⊥)
- relation
  - function returns predicate
- abbreviated function notations
  - 〈*x:D →* 〈*y:D → x &le; y*〉〉= 〈*x,y:D → x &le; y*〉
    - multiple variables
  - 〈*n:nat → n+1*〉 = 〈*n: → n+1*〉
    - only use when domain is known or doesn't matter
  - 〈*n: 2 → 3*〉 = *2 → 3*
    - constant function
    - scope brackets used with variables

#### Scope and Substitution

- local
  - bound, hidden, private
  - introduced in expression (formal)
- non-local
  - global, free, visible, public
  - introduced outside expression (formal or informal)
