- largest gas giant in the solar system
- can have northern lights
- four biggest moons are galilain moon
  - found by galilao
  - as large as terrestrial planets
  - Europa (2nd)
    - believed to have liquid water beneath ice layer
  - can be seen in modest binoculors

- Kuiper Belt
  - icy
  - very small
  - found beyond Neptune
- Aestroid belt
  - between Mars and Jupiter
- Drawf Planets can be found in the belts

## Lecture 4

### Dwarf Planets

- Beyond Neptune, in the Kuiper belt, there are a Kuiper Belt Objects
  - 2005 new KBO bigger than Pluto
    - Pluto no longer a planet
  - This object with several other objects as big as Pluto are called dwarf planets
- To find KBO, we take photos over a time frame and the distance travelled over the timeframe will show what it is
  - fast: asteroid
  - medium: KBO
  - slow: star
  - unmoving: galaxy?
- Definition:
  - is in orbit around the Sun
  - is close to round in shape
    - big enough objects in space will be round due to gravity
  - intersect with other dwarf planet/planet orbits.
    - has not "cleared the neighborhood"
  - is not a satellite
- small solar object: non-round objects orbitting the sun

### Sun

- center of our solar system
- giant gas ball
  - relative to planets
  - 99.8% of the mass in our solar system
- prominence are common
- transit
  - shadow of planets across star's surface
- middle aged
  - gets bigger and brighter as it ages

| Gas Giant          | Terrestrial Planet    |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| no solid surface   | solid (rocky) surface |
| solid/liquid cores | may have atmosphere   |

### Belts

- Between Mars and Jupiter is Asteroid Belt
- Beyond Neptune is the Kuiper Belt
  - Largest Objects in Kuiper Belt are called Dwarf Planets

### Interstellar space

- a million times larger than interplanetary space
- a million times smaller than intergalactic space

## Lecture 5

### interstellar space

- space between stars

  - usually thin gaseous material
  - giant interstellar gas clouds collapse due to gravity and becomes a star

- best way measure distance of nearby star: parallax star

  - in 6 month difference, see how much a star moves relative to background stars
  - closer the star, the bigger the movement of the star.
  - done since the 1800
  - easier for bigger orbits

- parsec or lightyear is used to measure far objects

  - parsec is around 3.3 lightyears
  - 1.3 parsec is around 4 lightyears (closest star)

- milky way has two satallite galaxies
- gaia space mission measures 1.7 billion stars

### intergalactic space

- million times larger than interstellar distances
- use Megaparsecs (million parsec) => millions of lightyears

- spiral galaxy

  - typical spiral galaxy has around 100 billion stars
    - has arms coming from the center
    - many new stars form along the arms
  - shaped like a frisbee, rotating
  - can be tens of thousands of lightyears across
  - density of stars decrease as we go closer to the edge
  - face on vs edge on are different angles to view galaxies
  - center has a bulge, flat at the edge

- eliptical galaxy

  - a lot less structure
    - bright center and fade towards the edge
  - not a disc like spiral galaxy
  - swarm of bees
  - very little gas

- galaxy zoo
  - crowdsource galaxy names

### galaxy collections

- galaxy groups: at least 3 galaxies affected by one another
- compact galaxy group

  - distances between galaxies are within each other's edge

- galaxy clusters: thousands of member galaxies
  - largest galaxies in the universe usually center of galaxy clusters
    - 1 trillion stars
  - clusters have different context when used to describe galaxy clusters vs star clusters

### Lookback Time

- light requires time to travel
- if light from far away travels to us, it takes longer than if the source was close by
- we are therefore always looking at the object in the past.
- used in galaxy evolution field.

## Lecture 6

### simulation

- how galaxys interact with nearby galaxies
  - giant gravity throws stars
  - colours change over time
    - blue: newer stars formations
    - red: merged galaxies
  - spiral galaxies merge to become eliptical galaxy

### cosmology

- study of origin and evolution of universe
- discovered in 1930 galaxies are getting farther away

  - implies universe is expanding (exponentially)

- distance to galaxies

  - can't use parallax
  - we compare with conventional knowledge (standard candle effect)
    - some objects has the same brightness always (supernova)
    - we take the amount of light coming from these objects to see how far they are
    - not precise and too slow
  - velocity of galaxy (Doppler shift)
    - light waves will stretch and squish as galaxies move
    - galaxies moving away shifts towards infrared (**redshift**)
    - galaxies moving towards shifts towards ultraviolet (**blueshift**)
    - to find if the lights are shifting
      - we find the spectrum lines of the elements making up the object giving off the light
      - if the spectrum lines are slightly more red or blue, it has shifted
    - every galaxy has a unique spectrum line
    - can measure distance and speed very percisely
      - larger distance, the faster it is moving away
      - almost all galaxies are redshifted
    - discovered by Edwin Hubble
      - Hubble's Law
      - Hubble-Lemaitre Law
        - Speed is porportional to distance
        - V = (Hubble's constant) \* distance
        - **V = H \* d**

- Expanding Universe
  - rather than galaxies moving
  - space is expanding between galaxies
  - raisin bread analogy
    - distance between raisins gets larger when bread rises

## Lecture 7

- **Hubble-Lemaitre Law**
  - relation between motion of a galaxy and its distance from us:
    - Speed: measured from amount of Doppler shift
      - towards infrared: moving farther
      - towards ultraviolet: moving closer
    - Distance: measured with standard candle technique
      - fainter = further
  - further away, the faster the speed
  - V = H \* d
- galaxies are not moving, rather the universe is expanding, and the space between galaxies are expanding

### Hubble's Law

- overall appearance of the universe should be changing with time
  - long ago, they are closer together
  - we can see this by looking farther
    - the father the object, the longer it takes the light to reach us
- universe may have a beginning
  - v = H \* d
    - speed = constant \* distance
  - d = v \* 1/H
    - distance = speed \* time
    - 1/H is a time
      - is time since expansion began
      - around **13 billion years** (13.8)
      - assumes rate of expansion is constant
  - to check
    - is the expansion the same in all directions
      - yes
    - measure galaxies in many different directions and find that 1/H is around the same
- what is the universe spanding into
- if universe is finite, what is beyond the universe
- will we reach a time where space was just dark and empty

## Lecture 8

- 2 ways to collect data:
  1. Imaging=Pictures
  2. Spectroscopy=Spectrum

### Imaging

- take pictures in Red, Green, Blue and combine them
  - pictures are taken greyscale with rgb filter
    - shows how much red, green, blue exist
  - cam take photos beyond visible spectrum
  - computer adds colour and combines the 3 pictures
- pretty

### Spectroscopy

- measure how much light at every wavelength
- specific wavelengths have extra light
  - plot in a graph
- can find out what objects in universe are made of

### Atmospheric Opacity

- astronomers can't view everything from the surface on the earth
- many times, we need to send telescopes into space
- Ultraviolet and shorter is blocked
- visible light is visible with little distortion
- visible spectrum is absorbed
- radiowave is observable
- longer wavelength is blocked
- Sound is not a electromagnetic radiation
  - it is a pressure wave
  - cannot travel through space
