# Intro to Psych

## Module 1

### Scientific Method

1. Construct Theory

- collect general set of ideas about the way the world works

2. Generate Hypothesis

- Form a stestable statement
- make specific predictions about the relationship between variables

3. Choose research Method

- Determine the way in which the hypothesis will be testsed

4. Collect data

- Take measurements of the outcomes of the test

5. Analyze data

- Understand the data
- discover trends or relationships between variables

6. Report findings

- Publish articles in scholarly journals
  - need peer reviews

7. Revise existing theories

- Incorporate new information into our understandings of the world

### Anecodtal evidence

- unsufficent
  - Single experience might not be representative of subsequent experiences
  - Personal experience might not represent others' experience
  - Energy drinks may not affect test performances and there are other factors in play

### Experiment

- Scientific tool used to measure the effect of one variable on another

#### Independent Variable

- directly manipulated by experimenter

#### Dependent Variable

- observed by the experimentor

| --                     | Independent        | Dependent          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Biology Experiment     | amount of enzyme   | cell growth        |
| Kinesiology Experiment | exercise intensity | % lean muscle mass |

#### Experimental Group

- recieve manipulation of independent variable

#### Control Groups

- will not recieve manipulation of independent variable

Ideally, members of experimental and control groups are very similar, so that the differences in the experiment is reduced to only the independent variable, and therefore the differences in the dependent variable can only be from the independent variable

### Within-Participants Design

- Manipulating the independent variable within each participant to minimize the effect of participant differences on the dependent measure.
- every participant is both control and experimental

#### Problems with Within-Participants Design

- **Burdens**
  - Time consuming
  - Potentially costly
- **Variablilty**
  - Measure/Participants may change during the experiment when manipulating the independant variable
  - **Practice Effect**
    - improvement in performance over course of an experiment as a result of experience
    - separate from effect of the independent variable

### Between-Participants Design

- Separate Experimental Group and Control Group
- Important to have as little differences between participants being compared, except independent variable

#### Problems with Between-Participants Design

- **Confounding Variable**
  - variable systematically varies with an independent variables, making it difficult to isolate the effect of independent variable
  - Can be age, race, diet, etc.

### Sampling

- Experimental group has to reflect the population we want to learn abotu in the study
  - Sample: subset of the population
- **Random Assignment**
  - assigning participants to either the experimental or control group at random
  - avoids systematic differences between groups of participants

### Placebo Effect

- individuals exhibit response to treatments that has no real therapeutic actions

#### Subject Bias

- subject bias can intentially or unintentially affect dependent variable
- can be avoided by **blinding** subjects to which group they are in.

#### Experimenter bias

- Actions made by experimenter, intentially or unintentially promotes the result they hope to achieve
- can be avoided by **double blinding** subjects and experimenter to which group the subjects are in.

## Module 2

### Descriptive Statistic

- Mean, Median, Mode
- Summarized Data at a glance
  - usually with graphs
- Histogram
  - reports number of times(frequency) groups of values (**bins**) appear in a data set
- Frequency Distribution
  - Smooth graph showing distribution of how frequently values appear in a data set
  - can use Histogram as a base of Frequency Distribution
- **Normal Distribution**
  - special distribution with symmetrical, bell shaped curve containing a single peak

#### Measures of Central Tendency

- Mean
  - average value of a data set
  - sum all data points by number of data points
  - can be affected by outliers
- Mode
  - most frequently appeared value in a data set
- Median
  - Center value in a data set
  - take average of two middle value if even number of data points
  - isn't affected very much by outliers

#### Measures of Variablilties

- **Standard Deviation**
  - std
  - describes how "spread out" the data is
  - higher std, more spread out

### Inferential Statistics

- Statistics that allow us to use results from samples to make inferences about overall, underlying populations.
- Compares the distributions of experimental group to control group.
  - control group represents the "general" population
  - experimental group should be a differnt population that is represented by the change in independent variable.
    - ex. a population of people that are vegan

#### T-test

- statistical test that considers each data point from both groups to calculate the probability that two samples were drawn from the same population
- **P-Value**
  - probability (0-100%) indicating how likely this difference would be observed even if no "real" difference exists
  - smaller p-value: more significant (**&le;5% -> statistcally significant**)
    - more likely independent variable correlates to dependent variable
  - at least 95% confident difference exists between experimental and control groups.
- Statistical Significance
  - differences between 2 groups is due to some true differences between them rather than random variation
  - Statistical does not mean meaningful

### Error

#### Type 1 Error

- believing there is a difference when difference doesn't exist
- a man told he is pregnant

#### Type 2 Error

- **Miss**
- Failing to see a difference when a difference does exist
- a pregnant woman told she isn't pregnant

### Observational Research

- used when direct experimentation may be unethical
- look for significant differences between two groups
  - cancer rates between general population and smoking population

#### Correlation

- measure of the strength of relationship between two variables
- **Correlation Coefficient**
  - r
  - strength and direction of correlation
  - between -1 and 1
  - r = 1
    - perfect positive correlation
    - as one variable increase, the other decrease
  - r = -1
    - perfect negative correlation
    - as one variable increase, the other decrease
  - r = 0
    - no correlation between two variables
    - no relationship between two variables
- Correlation does not equal causation
  - confounding variables appear very often in observational research

## Module 3

- Unconditioned Stimulus
- Unconditional Response
- Conditioned Response

### Unconscious learning

- Classical Conditioning, Instrumental Conditioning

### Classical Conditioning

- Pavlovian conditioning
- Pavlov
  - Taught dogs that bell sound means food is being served
  - bell sounds didn't cause any response from dog before being taught
  - after being taught, dogs started salivating from the sound of bells even if no food is being served
    - called conditional reflex
- Contingences relationships
  - one stimulus reliably predicts the presentation of another
  - once learned, **a subject can respond to signal before the event even occurs**
- The learning of a contingency between a particular signal and a later event that are paired in time and/or space

#### Unconditional Stimulus

- US
- any stimulus or event
- occurs naturally
- subject has not learned or doesn't need to learn what events follow

#### Unconditional Response

- UR
- response that follow the US
- occurs naturally
- doesn't need to be learned

#### Conditional Stimulus

- CS
- previously a neutral event
- associated with an US to produce learned contingency
- bell sound -> food eaten
- occurs before US

#### Conditional Response

- response occues after contingency between CS and US learned
- bell sound -> salivating

#### Aquisition

- process by which a contingency between a CS and US is learned
- negatively exponential curve.
- Example
  - Rat tasting poison (CS)
  - becomes sick (US)
  - avoids food that makes it sick (AR)
  - the taste/smell is associated with poison (CR)

#### Standard model for classical conditioning

- does the response require any prior learning?
  - **NO**: Unconditioned
  - **YES**: Conditioned
- is it triggering event or outcome?
  - **EVENT**: Stimulus
  - **OUTCOME**: Response

#### Extinction

- how long does contingency last?
  - as long as contingency is reliable
- The loss of the CR when CS no longer predicts US
  - present CS when US isn't there
- Unlearn or **new learning that inhibit CS**

#### Spontaneous Recovery

- sudden recovery of CR following rest period after extinction
- proves that Extinction doesn't require subjects to relearn the CS, as they can evoke the CR again

### Generalizaton and Discrimination

- CS may not be identical everytiem

#### Stimulus Generalization

- stimuli similar to CS will also elicit CR
- Example
  - sound of 500Hz generate CR
  - sound of 450Hz also generate CR, maybe less so
- we can plot a standard deviation of potential CS to the level of response from the subject

#### Stimulus Discrimination

- we can use extinction to lower the bell curve of the standard deviation over times so the level of the response is smaller.
- if the extinction is used at a specific stimuli, the nearby stimuli can also lower in a bell curve
  - specific stimuli (CS-) is not paired with US. (absence of US)
  - can be more precise if parallel to it, CS (CS+) is paired with US (presense of US)

### Phobias

- exaggerated response of fear to specific thing, place, people, etc
  - often related to a truamatic experience
  - getten bitten by snake
  - scary stories

#### Therapies

- Implosive Therapy

  - force the subject to confront their phobia with an absence of the US

- Systematic Desensitation
  - gradual exposure
  - uses generalization gradient
    - extinguishing fears from extremes (of the gradient) inwards
  - takes time, and more money

### Homeostatis

- body at a state of stable conditions
- when injesting food, or when we move
  - body responds by releasing insulin, digest, etc to try and get back to homeostatis

### Compensatory Responses

- When the body is expecting a change, the Compensatory Response counteracts
  - drinking sugary pop, insulin is released when we taste it
- Can backfire if the CS is not paired with US
- Drug can often create Compensatory Response
  - withdrawl symptoms when presented similar situation to drug delivery (syringe) but no US (drug)
