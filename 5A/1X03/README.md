# Intro to Psych

## Module 1

### Scientific Method

1. Construct Theory

- collect general set of ideas about the way the world works

2. Generate Hypothesis

- Form a stestable statement
- make specific predictions about the relationship between variables

3. Choose research Method

- Determine the way in which the hypothesis will be testsed

4. Collect data

- Take measurements of the outcomes of the test

5. Analyze data

- Understand the data
- discover trends or relationships between variables

6. Report findings

- Publish articles in scholarly journals
  - need peer reviews

7. Revise existing theories

- Incorporate new information into our understandings of the world

### Anecodtal evidence

- unsufficent
  - Single experience might not be representative of subsequent experiences
  - Personal experience might not represent others' experience
  - Energy drinks may not affect test performances and there are other factors in play

### Experiment

- Scientific tool used to measure the effect of one variable on another

#### Independent Variable

- directly manipulated by experimenter

#### Dependent Variable

- observed by the experimentor

| --                     | Independent        | Dependent          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Biology Experiment     | amount of enzyme   | cell growth        |
| Kinesiology Experiment | exercise intensity | % lean muscle mass |

#### Experimental Group

- recieve manipulation of independent variable

#### Control Groups

- will not recieve manipulation of independent variable

Ideally, members of experimental and control groups are very similar, so that the differences in the experiment is reduced to only the independent variable, and therefore the differences in the dependent variable can only be from the independent variable

### Within-Participants Design

- Manipulating the independent variable within each participant to minimize the effect of participant differences on the dependent measure.
- every participant is both control and experimental

#### Problems with Within-Participants Design

- **Burdens**
  - Time consuming
  - Potentially costly
- **Variablilty**
  - Measure/Participants may change during the experiment when manipulating the independant variable
  - **Practice Effect**
    - improvement in performance over course of an experiment as a result of experience
    - separate from effect of the independent variable

### Between-Participants Design

- Separate Experimental Group and Control Group
- Important to have as little differences between participants being compared, except independent variable

#### Problems with Between-Participants Design

- **Confounding Variable**
  - variable systematically varies with an independent variables, making it difficult to isolate the effect of independent variable
  - Can be age, race, diet, etc.

### Sampling

- Experimental group has to reflect the population we want to learn abotu in the study
  - Sample: subset of the population
- **Random Assignment**
  - assigning participants to either the experimental or control group at random
  - avoids systematic differences between groups of participants

### Placebo Effect

- individuals exhibit response to treatments that has no real therapeutic actions

#### Subject Bias

- subject bias can intentially or unintentially affect dependent variable
- can be avoided by **blinding** subjects to which group they are in.

#### Experimenter bias

- Actions made by experimenter, intentially or unintentially promotes the result they hope to achieve
- can be avoided by **double blinding** subjects and experimenter to which group the subjects are in.

## Module 2

### Descriptive Statistic

- Mean, Median, Mode
- Summarized Data at a glance
  - usually with graphs
- Histogram
  - reports number of times(frequency) groups of values (**bins**) appear in a data set
- Frequency Distribution
  - Smooth graph showing distribution of how frequently values appear in a data set
  - can use Histogram as a base of Frequency Distribution
- **Normal Distribution**
  - special distribution with symmetrical, bell shaped curve containing a single peak

#### Measures of Central Tendency

- Mean
  - average value of a data set
  - sum all data points by number of data points
  - can be affected by outliers
- Mode
  - most frequently appeared value in a data set
- Median
  - Center value in a data set
  - take average of two middle value if even number of data points
  - isn't affected very much by outliers

#### Measures of Variablilties

- **Standard Deviation**
  - std
  - describes how "spread out" the data is
  - higher std, more spread out

### Inferential Statistics

- Statistics that allow us to use results from samples to make inferences about overall, underlying populations.
- Compares the distributions of experimental group to control group.
  - control group represents the "general" population
  - experimental group should be a differnt population that is represented by the change in independent variable.
    - ex. a population of people that are vegan

#### T-test

- statistical test that considers each data point from both groups to calculate the probability that two samples were drawn from the same population
- **P-Value**
  - probability (0-100%) indicating how likely this difference would be observed even if no "real" difference exists
  - smaller p-value: more significant (**&le;5% -> statistcally significant**)
    - more likely independent variable correlates to dependent variable
  - at least 95% confident difference exists between experimental and control groups.
- Statistical Significance
  - differences between 2 groups is due to some true differences between them rather than random variation
  - Statistical does not mean meaningful

### Error

#### Type 1 Error

- believing there is a difference when difference doesn't exist
- a man told he is pregnant

#### Type 2 Error

- **Miss**
- Failing to see a difference when a difference does exist
- a pregnant woman told she isn't pregnant

### Observational Research

- used when direct experimentation may be unethical
- look for significant differences between two groups
  - cancer rates between general population and smoking population

#### Correlation

- measure of the strength of relationship between two variables
- **Correlation Coefficient**
  - r
  - strength and direction of correlation
  - between -1 and 1
  - r = 1
    - perfect positive correlation
    - as one variable increase, the other decrease
  - r = -1
    - perfect negative correlation
    - as one variable increase, the other decrease
  - r = 0
    - no correlation between two variables
    - no relationship between two variables
- Correlation does not equal causation
  - confounding variables appear very often in observational research

## Module 3

- Unconditioned Stimulus
- Unconditional Response
- Conditioned Response

### Unconscious learning

- Classical Conditioning, Instrumental Conditioning

### Classical Conditioning

- Pavlovian conditioning
- Pavlov
  - Taught dogs that bell sound means food is being served
  - bell sounds didn't cause any response from dog before being taught
  - after being taught, dogs started salivating from the sound of bells even if no food is being served
    - called conditional reflex
- Contingences relationships
  - one stimulus reliably predicts the presentation of another
  - once learned, **a subject can respond to signal before the event even occurs**
- The learning of a contingency between a particular signal and a later event that are paired in time and/or space

#### Unconditional Stimulus

- US
- any stimulus or event
- occurs naturally
- subject has not learned or doesn't need to learn what events follow

#### Unconditional Response

- UR
- response that follow the US
- occurs naturally
- doesn't need to be learned

#### Conditional Stimulus

- CS
- previously a neutral event
- associated with an US to produce learned contingency
- bell sound -> food eaten
- occurs before US

#### Conditional Response

- response occues after contingency between CS and US learned
- bell sound -> salivating

#### Aquisition

- process by which a contingency between a CS and US is learned
- negatively exponential curve.
- Example
  - Rat tasting poison (CS)
  - becomes sick (US)
  - avoids food that makes it sick (AR)
  - the taste/smell is associated with poison (CR)

#### Standard model for classical conditioning

- does the response require any prior learning?
  - **NO**: Unconditioned
  - **YES**: Conditioned
- is it triggering event or outcome?
  - **EVENT**: Stimulus
  - **OUTCOME**: Response

#### Extinction

- how long does contingency last?
  - as long as contingency is reliable
- The loss of the CR when CS no longer predicts US
  - present CS when US isn't there
- Unlearn or **new learning that inhibit CS**

#### Spontaneous Recovery

- sudden recovery of CR following rest period after extinction
- proves that Extinction doesn't require subjects to relearn the CS, as they can evoke the CR again

### Generalizaton and Discrimination

- CS may not be identical everytiem

#### Stimulus Generalization

- stimuli similar to CS will also elicit CR
- Example
  - sound of 500Hz generate CR
  - sound of 450Hz also generate CR, maybe less so
- we can plot a standard deviation of potential CS to the level of response from the subject

#### Stimulus Discrimination

- we can use extinction to lower the bell curve of the standard deviation over times so the level of the response is smaller.
- if the extinction is used at a specific stimuli, the nearby stimuli can also lower in a bell curve
  - specific stimuli (CS-) is not paired with US. (absence of US)
  - can be more precise if parallel to it, CS (CS+) is paired with US (presence of US)

### Phobias

- exaggerated response of fear to specific thing, place, people, etc
  - often related to a truamatic experience
  - getten bitten by snake
  - scary stories

#### Therapies

- Implosive Therapy

  - force the subject to confront their phobia with an absence of the US

- Systematic Desensitation
  - gradual exposure
  - uses generalization gradient
    - extinguishing fears from extremes (of the gradient) inwards
  - takes time, and more money

### Homeostatis

- body at a state of stable conditions
- when injesting food, or when we move
  - body responds by releasing insulin, digest, etc to try and get back to homeostatis

### Compensatory Responses

- When the body is expecting a change, the Compensatory Response counteracts
  - drinking sugary pop, insulin is released when we taste it
- Can backfire if the CS is not paired with US
- Drug can often create Compensatory Response
  - withdrawl symptoms when presented similar situation to drug delivery (syringe) but no US (drug)

## Lecture 2

### Learning

- Pavlov
- reflexive responses associate with cues
  - predict events that will occur
- Watson
- Skinner
  - Prediction and control of behaviour
  - instrumental conditioning

### Non-associative learning: info about one external stimulus

- habituation:
  - decrease in behavioural responding to repeated stimulus
  - important as body is cautious about new environment
    - just wearing clothes can feel the touch of clothes
- Sensitization
  - increase in behavioral responding to repeated stimulus
  - Watching horror movies, and someone pokes

### Non-associative learning: how two or more pieces of info are relatev

- Classical conditioningL learning that two stimuli go together
- Operant conditioning: learn that a behavior leads to a particular outcome
- long term ...

### Drug addiction

- 20% addiction rate in war vets
  - general population had 0.3%
- detox stations were used to curb
  - generally would relapse 20%
  - soldiers relapse rate is 5%
- what causes enigmatic opiate overdose?
  - body becomes tolerant of drugs over multiple use
  - but some days the body gets weaker, so the dose they regularly can take can overdose them.
- drug aren't administered in isolation
  - tradition
  - rolling a joint, etc.
  - leads to addiction

### Homeostasis

- UCS -> CNS -> UCR
  - unconditional
- CS -> CR

## Module 4

### Instrumental Conditioning

- How does an action lead to consequences
- aka Operant Conditioning
- Puzzle Box
  - small chamber that can be opened by doing a small thing
  - reward is visible outside the box
  - cat starts by random behaviour, eventually doing the action
- the random behaviours that don't lead to escape doesn't happen as often in later trials
  - little conscience
- stamping in: behaviour maintained
- stamping out: behaviour lost
- eventually learns contingency with puzzle and escape/food

#### Law of Effect

- Behaviours with positive consequences are stamped in
- Behaviours with negative consequences are stamped out

### Different types of Instrumental Conditioning

| Increase in behaviour | **_Presentation_** of **positive** reinforcer | **_Removal_** of a **negative** reinforcer |
| :-------------------: | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Decrease in behaviour | **_Presentation_** of **negative** reinforcer | **_Removal_** of a **positive** reinforcer |

#### Reward Training

- presenting a positive reinforcer to encourage a specific behaviour

#### Punishment Training

- presenting a negative reinforcer to discourage a specific behaviour
- contraversial as a contingency can be formed between the figure presenting negative reinforcer and punishment
  - child feeling fear when seeing parents

#### Omission Training

- removing a positive reinforcer to discourage a behaviour
- "Time outs" in school
- not equal to punishment

#### Escape Training

- removing a negative reinforcer to encourage a behaviour
- escaping a negative environment
- rat avoids floor with electric shock

### Aquisition and Shaping

- instrumental conditioning, a subject learns the contingency between response and consequence

#### Cumulative Recorders

- records the response rate of behaviour
- originally, pen and paper, now a computer system
- graph shows
  - line with each upwards slope a response being made

#### AutoShaping

- learning without direct guidance
- pigeon pecking a hole to get food
- can be recorded easily

#### Shaping

- Shaping is used for behaviours too complex
- training dophins to backflip for food
- breakdown complex behaviour into smaller more simple behaviours
- BF Skinner
  - pigeons pecking balls to each other
  - starts with pecking table
  - move to pecking to the other side of table
  - becomes stricter to get food as more complex behaviours are trained.

---

- Contingencies are not always valid

### Discriminative Stimulus

- SD
  - when the response will predict the reinforcement
  - when child eats vegetables at home and gets dessert
- Sδ
  - S-
  - when the response will not predict the reinforcement
  - when child eats vegetables at grandparents home and doesn't get dessert
- Discriminative Stimulus can be generalized for a varied response rate
  - generalization stimulus
  - subject may respond to stimulus similar to SD and may not respond to stimulus similar to Sδ
- psychologists can manipulate
  - SD
  - Sδ
  - reinforcement
  - lack of reinforcement
- Extinction can be used to alter Generalization Gradient
  - similar stimulus to SD can be presented with a lack of reinforcement, which extincts the stimulus.
  - becomes a Sδ
- CS is not SD
  - CS is involuntary paired with CR
  - SD is voluntary paired with reinforcement
    - The subject knows they can get the reinforcement, but they have a choice to perform the response to get reinforcement.

### Schedules of Reinforcement

- continuous reinforcement
  - correct reinforcement or lack of occurs in every trail
  - very rare in real life
  - usually partial reinforcement schedule

#### Partial Reinforcement

- Ratio Schedule
  - [F|V]R-x
  - reinforcement occurs every x amount of times response is performed
    - FR-10 every 10 pecks
- Interval Schedule
  - [F|V]I-i
  - reinforcement occurs every i time(minutes) after last reward
    - FR-1 every 1 minute
- Fixed Schedule
  - consistent reoccurence of reinforcements
- Variable Schedule
  - on average, reinforcements occur consistently, but not consecutively
  - VR-3
    - rewards given every 1,2,3,4,2,5,6 responses
    - averages to around 3 responses per reward

| ---      | Fixed | Variable |
| -------- | ----- | -------- |
| Ratio    | FR-#  | VR-#     |
| Interval | FI-#  | VI-#     |

#### Fixed Ratio

- ineffective if the ratio of behaviour to rewards is too high
- follows "pause and run" pattern for behavourial responses
  - after reinforcement, there is a pause before another run of job

#### Variable Ratio

- Example is slot machine
  - gives rewards once enough plays
  - players can easily get invested on one machine
- can support a high response rate of behaviour
- slope of VR schedule tells average number of responses before reinforcement
  - higher reinforcement rate, higher response rate
  - higher reinforcement rate, larger slope

#### Fixed Interval

- example is a quiz every x weeks
  - student may study more as quiz approaches
- shows scallop pattern
  - lull period right after reinforcement
  - most intense right before reinforcement

#### Variable Interval

- shows "straight" line
- higher reinforcement rate, larger slope

---

- Learning is more robust on a partial learning schedule than a continuous one
- Lower reinforcement rate would mean that extinction is less likely
  - intuitively, in lower reinforcement rate, subject is less likely to notice that reinforcement is not occuring than when the rate is very often.

## Lecture 3

### Classical Conditioning as a child

- Jaws sets up shark attack with music
  - associating jaws music with sharks

#### We learn effects of behavior through Operant Conditioning

### Instrumental Conditioning in the world

- Steve Woz
  - created jamming device
- Speeding on the highway
  - Try to maintain speed with other drivers rather than follow the exact speed limit
  - SD is someone monitoring speed
  - SR is punishment in speeding ticket
- Training to study
  - give positive rewards
    - allowing social media
  - omission of social media
  - set up environment for wanting to study

### Reinforcers in Behavior Modifications

- Primary Reinforcers
  - biological neets
    - food
    - sleep
    - sex
- Secondary Reinforcers
  - established through classical conditioning
    - money

### Dopamine

- nucleus accumbens is where dopamine activity occurs

### Biological predisposition

- learn through modeling behavior
- opening and closing mouth to new born, baby will follow
- humans are able to learn

## Module 5

### Intelligence

- psychologists generally have 2 categories
  - ability to do cognitive tasks
  - capacity to learn from past experiences and adapt
- cognitive ability of an individual to learn from experience, reason well, remember important information, and cope with the demands of daily living
- not everyone can agree how intelligence should be defined

#### Problem Solving

- reliable indicator of intelligence
- 2 forms of reasoning
  - **Deductive Reasoning**
    - works from Ideas/General Information
    - works to Specific Conclusions
  - **Inductive Reasoning**
    - works from Specific Facts
    - works to General Idea
- In Scientific Method
  - Take theory
  - use Deductive Reasoning to make Hypothesis
  - Gather Facts(data) in experiments
  - Use Inductive Reasoning to Interprete Data
- Insight Problems
  - require thinking outside the box

### Intelligence Testing

- Qualities of a Test
  - Reliability
    - produces same result if one person takes it mulitiple times
    - especially important for intelligence test as intelligence is assumed to be a static trait
  - Validity
    - valid tests actually measures the trait it is supposed to be measuring

#### Galton's intelligence test

- reaction time to sensory motion
- faster reaction time implies higher reaction

#### Binet

- first intelligence scale
- used reasoning to test children about intelligence
- Lewis Terman, psychologist at Stanford revised the test to **Standford-Binet**

#### Spearman

- believed single intelligence reflected overall performance
  - math, language, music, etc
- single intelligence measured with _g_
- believed that minimum _g_ required to vote and reproduce

#### Gardner

- different/distinct intelligence
  - Verbal (linguistic)
  - Mathematical (logical)
  - Musical (rythmic)
  - Spatial (visual)
  - Kinesthetic (bodily)
  - Interpersonal
  - Intrapersonal
  - Naturalistic
- popular with media
- critics point out that some intelligence in one correlate with another, so it is likely connected
- often romantic ideas are used haphazardly before scientific proof is fully revealed

#### Weschler

- Most popular intelligence tests today
  - often uses patterns and puzzles
- Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)
- Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)
- IQ are perfectly normally distributed
  - 100 is mean
  - standard deviation of 15
  - one person's IQ is relative to population

#### Genetic and Environmental Contribution

- does Genes or Environment contribute more to IQ
  - does differences in IQ result from differences in Genes or Environment
- studies with Identical/Fraternal Twins show that Genes seem to have an impact
  - but environment also show impact comparing Fraternal Twins with strangers
  - Genetic Twins raised in different environments also show correlation with Genes being a strong contributer to IQ
  - Impossible to conclude necessarily as correlation does not mean causation

#### Flynn Effect

- observations that raw IQ scores are on the rise since 1932
  - scores that result in 100 has been going higher
- Flynn thinks quality of school
  - also nutrition and health increase
  - increase of access to information

### Piaget and Intelligence Development

- Jean Piaget credited intellecual development to active learning in childhood
- **Schema**
  - A mental framework for interpreting the world around us
  - child doesn't have fully developed schema
- **Assimilation**
  - Incorporation new information into existing schemas
- **Accomodation**
  - Modify existing schemas to fit incompatible information
  - done when assimilation does not work

#### Sequential Stages of Cognitive Development

- must be done in this order
- each stage may be done in different rates

#### Sensorimotor

- 0-2 years old
- child recognize he can affect environment
- **Object Permanence**
  - objects continue to exist when no longer visible

#### Preoperational

- 2-7 years old
- mastered object permanence but has few limitations
  - **Egocentrism**
    - difficulty understanding world other than itself
  - **Seriation**
    - logically order series of objects
  - **Reversable Relationships**
    - difficulty understanding themselves in the relationship with others
      - daughter with no sisters may not realize her mother has a daughter
  - **Conservation**
    - difficulty understanding that properties are conserved after physical transformation
      - glass of water poured into a different shaped glass may seem like more or less water to a child

#### Concrete Operational

- 7-12 years old
- has problem with more abstract ideas

#### Formal Operational

- has adult cognitive ability
- usually enjoys more fantasy/role playing subjects
  - video games, books, etc.

#### Flaws

- Some children develop skills in different order to piaget's order
- language translations may have different meanings

### Decisions and Bias

- flip A and 7
  - if 7 has vowel behind, then it proves hypothesis false
  - flipping 4 doesn't prove anything
  - flipping A to make sure hypothesis is true
- **Confirmation Bias**
  - tendency to seek out information to support hypothesis
  - can occur in diagnosis when asking follow up questions
- **Availability Heuristic**
  - tendency to make decisions based on information most quickly available to us
  - allows us to quickly make decisions without needing much thought
    - good for easy simple decisions
    - media and advertisements can greatly impact our decisions due to this
- **Representative Heuristic**
  - tendency to assume that what we are seeing is representative of the larger category we have in our mind
  - we have a model of a archetype, even if its not very common relative to the population
    - we associate the traits of the archetype to that archetype even if its unlikely.
  - we also may assume that sequence of independent random events may lead to better odds of a specific result
    - gamblers are prone to this
      - gambler's fallacy

## Lecture 4

- 302 neurons is enough for problem solving
- intelligence is impossible to measure directly
  - indirectly measured
  - hypothetical construct
- behaviourism, on the other hand, is directly measureable
- we need to define it, but very confidential

### tests of intelligence

- Functional fixedness
  - cognitive bias limiting a person to use an object
- Reason well
- Louisiana Literacy test

### Do humans behave reliability

- **anchoring** set ceiling for highest price you will pay
  - makes cheaper but expensive wine more affordable

#### Bazerman and moore (2013)

- define problem
- identify criteria necessary to judge
- weigh the criteria
- generate alternatives
- rate each alternative
- compute optimal decision

## Module 6

### Language

- most complex form of communication
- language is **regular**
  - governed by rules and grammer
  - sentences can be reordered and keep its meaning
- language is **arbitrary**
  - the specific sound meant to represent an object/concept is completely arbitrary
  - the word "cat" doesn't say anything to reference a furry whiskered animal
- language is **productive**
  - almost limitless ways to describe objects, situation and actions
  - particularly evident in native language development in infants
    - experiment novel words and sound combinations that haven't been explicitly taught

#### How does Language develop

- **Whorf-Sapir Hypothesis**: Language influences our thoughts and the way we perceive and experience the world
  - we think in our native language, even though we don't need to
  - Tribe in Brazil
    - only three counting words
      - 1, 2, many
    - when asked to group objects into 1, 2 or many
      - performed well only with 1, 2
      - suggests that fine numerical observation is lacking
        - supports Whorf-Saphir
  - Wyoming Arapahoe use single word to describe senior male relative
    - older brother, father, uncle, grandfather, etc
    - They still understand differences between relatives and how they relate.
      - counters Whorf-Sapir
    - English is similar
      - Asian languages like Mandarin and Korean have even more specific words for uncle on the mother or father's side
      - despite this, english speakers don't have trouble understanding if an uncle is on the mother or father's side
- key question is can one have abstract thought without language?

#### Structure of Language

- Morpheme
  - smallest unit of sound that contains information
  - often a word contains multiple morphemes
  - Table is a morpheme
  - tablecloth is a word that contains 2 morphemes
    - table
    - cloth
  - Tables has 2 morphemes
    - table
    - s
      - indicates multiple
  - -ing and -ed are morphemes
  - Phonemes are the smallest unit of sounds in a word
    - makes up the morphemes
    - dog
      - /d/ /o/ /g/
    - /ch/ /ai/ /r/
    - /k/ /v/ /t/
      - doesn't work
- syntax
  - rules that govern how words in a sentence are put together
  - grammer
  - French adds grammatical gender to words
  - English does not
  - not easy to define
- semantics
  - meaning in the words

#### Infants Developing Language

- Babbling
  - drawn-out sounds made of a combinations of vowels and consonants
  - may sound like a real sentence/question because of use of inflection and rhythm in the production of the babble
  - Combinations progress to become real words
- 1.5-6 years old
  - Language "explodes"
- segmenting individual words is difficult in speech of a foreign language
  - unfamiliar language sounds very fast
  - hard to indentify specific words
- infants were tested to see if they can segment a familiarized word from the speech stream
  - given a target word
  - used in speech stream
  - when turned 2
    - strong positive correlation of segmentation ability with expressive vocabulary

#### Universal Phonemes Sensitivity

- infants can distinguish more phonemes than adults
- ability of infants to discriminate between any sounds they're tested on
- includes sounds from non-native languages
- head turn procedure
  - 2 speakers
  - play a phoneme in both alternating
    - reward given when one's head turns towards both
  - keep playing same phoneme until the testee loses interest
  - when new phoneme plays repeat
- children loses this ability within the first year

#### Theories of Language Development

- **social learning theory**
  - the environment one grew up in dictates how language is used
  - children learn through operant conditioning and imitation
- children cannot learn purely through social learning theory
  - learn too quickly and many novel mistakes that are never made by adults
  - overextension
    - categorize objects too broadly
      - every 4 leg animal is doggie
    - use -ed to run
  - underextension
    - catergorize objects too specifically
      - only one's dog is doggie
- **Language Acquisition Device**
  - all languages have universal fundamental rules
  - innate mechanism
    - only in humans that helps language develop rapidly according to universal rules
  - Congenitally deaf children develop universal sign language without formally learning it
  - Infants show response to the first language they are exposed to
    - prefer listening to speech rather than non-speech sound

#### Animal Communication

- Honey Bees
  - Waggle dance to communicate location of food
    - waggle phase
      - direction and distance
      - distance of waggle -> distance of food
      - angle of waggle -> direction of food
- Birds
  - songs for communication and competition
- Washoe
  - taught to use American Sign Language
  - can use to communicate simple request
  - not yet language
    - doesn't use grammer
- Sarah
  - use symbols to communicate
  - used large vocabulary
  - could not generate new sentences
- Kanzi
  - use lexigrams to communicate
  - used full immersion instead of classical conditioning
  - could communicate novel request
  - limited grammer

## Lecture 5

- communications between humans are easy
  - if both are good at same language
- different languages are harder
  - lost in translation
- English in Foreign Countries
  - sometimes not properly translated
- getting chinese/japanese words tattoed
  - often mistranlated
- english by itself don't make sense
  - makes it hard to learn

### creating new languages

- need 2 rules
  - Grammer
  - Lexicon
    - vocabulary

### Changing cultural value

- give, get
- can see how cultures will react to things through language

### Why do we swear

- why do people get upset by certain words
- why do we use certain words to get people upset
- Basal Ganglia and Limbic System
  - Right hemisphere
  - Basal Ganglia
  - Amygdala
- Swearing as a weapon
  - easy to use to trigger
    - compare to fighting
  - lazy
- different languages usually focus on 1-2 contents of swearing
  - french
    - supernatural
  - english
    - body/sexuality

#### Contents of swearing

- Supernatural
- Body effluvia and organs
  - ass, etc
- Disease, death and sickness
  - a pox on you
- Sexuality

---

- Euphimism
- Dysphemism
- Emphatic swearing
- Cathartic Swearing
  - Rage-circuit theory
    - Mammels injured or confined
    - emit sudden angry noises

### Language Conclusion

- All species communicate but language is special
- It's important to get a second optinion before getting a tattoo
- Developing a language is a full-time job
- Humans are guided by emotions

## Module 7

### Science of Learning

- cramming is not efficient nor is it good for remembering
- **Where**
  - why you should be mindful of distractions in your environment and proactively suppress them
- **When**
  - why it's more efficient to distribute your studying over time and across multiple sessions
- **How**
  - why practice testing and self-explanation are better than rereading, highlighting or copying notes verbatim
- **Desirable Difficulties**
  - why strategies that initially slow down learning can actually be most efficient in the long run

#### Multi-tasking

- task switching
- less efficient to switch between studying and social media
  - even if it
- driving
  - talking on a cellphone with or without handheld is as detrimental as drunk driving
- Pomodoro
  1. set timer for a time
  - ex: ~20 min
  2. after timer rings, allow for short break
  - ex: ~5-10 min
  3. repeat 1-2 multiple times
  - ex: 3-4x
  4. take a longer break
  - ex: ~30 min
- cultivate an environment where you can proactively suppress distractions
  - block social media
  - make phone silent
  - set aside time where you should study

#### When to study

- Cramming is generally bad due to
  - little time for clarification
- Hermann Ebbinghaus
  - pioneer memory researcher
  - Did a test on himself
    - memorize 12 random syllable
    - cramming all the studying in one day required 68 restudy attempts
    - distributing studying required 38 attempts
    - **Spacing Effect**
- another experiment
  - study a stack of flash cards
  - cramming case studied 8 times the day before the test
  - spacing case studied 2 times over 4 days before the test
  - spacing case retained about 20% more
- Spacing Effect doesn't have to be memorization
  - hobbies
    - video games
    - sports

#### How to Study

- studying is never really taught to students
- repeated exposure
  - examples
    - rereading
    - highlighting
    - underlining
  - only inputs data
    - doesn't really work
    - "one way street"
  - 84% of students use it in a study
    - 54% of this group rate it first
  - why is it popular?
    - rapid short-term learning
    - intuitive & endorsed
    - Effect of fluency
- we should really be outputting knowledge along with the input of knowledge
  - practice testing
    - an experiment done on nursing students
      - 15% increase in marks on average
    - **retrieval practice effect**
  - self-explanation
- retrieval practice effect can be combined with spacing effect
  - Initially, don't stop until you can recall information 3 separate times in session
  - Later prace retrieving same material three more times, in 3 sessions, 1 week apart
    - retrieve once per session
  - this is the most efficient learning
- can further increase learning by mixing topics
  - have all the study topics and quiz materials open at the start rather than locking the quiz materials after each study topic is taught
    - mixed topic outperformed by 20% when given a novel questions.
  - when studying, mix questions from every unit

#### Desirable Difficulty

- slow down learning, but most efficient and long lasting

## Lecture 6

- Durable Learning is the long game of academics
- Spreading learning is more efficient.
  - no need to relearn later
- understand the goal and tools
- be proactive rather than reactive
- Make restoration part of the workflow
- education is a marathon
- actively plan each day
  - what tasks should get done today
  - how much time is required
- input and output information
- successive relearning
  - test 3 times after learning
- overwhelmed mind tends to wander

## Module 8

### Categories & Concepts

- everyday decisions rely on quick categorization abilities
  - attention
  - memory
- without the ability to categorize, every decision becomes overwhelming
  - every experience would be unique
- ever-occurring and often intuitive

#### Functions of Categorization

- Classification
  - ability to classify dissimilar objects together in the same group
- Understanding
  - ability to evaluate a situation and act appropriately based on prior experiences
- Communication
  - ability to describe complex ideas or objects using a single label

#### Illusion of the Expert

- the feeling that a task must be simple for everyone because it is simple for oneself

### Rules

- is there a set of rules that let us define objects in a category
  - can we use this set of rules to identify new members of a category
- passable for specific and simple categories like
  - dog, cat, tree, bottle, etc.
  - people assume that if it is easy to categorize, it must have a simple rule
    - illusion of the expert
- very hard to make a set of simple rules for complex categories
  - fruit, furniture, beauty, justice

### Prototype Theory

- we categorize objects by comparing them to an internal "best" representation of a given object
  - can be an average representation
  - fruit: apple
  - bird: robin
- new objects are compared to the prototype
- classic study
  - time till reponse
  - "robin is a bird"
    - very fast
  - "penguin is a bird"
    - significantly slower
- can't explain all findings
  - prototypes should be stable over time
  - we can often change our preception of an object over time
    - new representations are less likely to shift prototypes, especially with more and more members in the category
- better for simple categorizations

### Exemplar Theory

- we categorize objects by comparing them to every previously stored experience (exemplar) in a given category
- new members can join by being similar enough to at least one previous experience
- explains why we respond quicker to more familiar birds
  - much more likely to remember a familiar bird than atypical bird since there are so many more experiences with a familiar bird
- Diagnoses are influenced by Exemplar Theory
  - dermatologists are asked to diagnose a set of skin diseases and again 2 weeks later
  - 20% more accurate second time
  - prototype theory would predict that viewing more sets of skin diseases wouldn't change a diagnoses accuracy
  - exemplar theory would predict that viewing more sets of skin diseases would allow better accuracy in the future
- better for complex categorizations

| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Categorizes by comparing object to                                  | internal average                      | past, similar objects |
| Can explain why a sinlge encounter changes categorization patterns? | no                                    | yes                   |
| Can explain why we respond faster to more representative objects?   | **yes**                               | **yes**               |
| Other                                                               | explains simple categorization better | -                     |

### Development of Categorizations

- Children as young as 3 can understand and generalize categories
- they can have a deeper understanding of categorization
  - hypothetical categorizations
  - innate properties of a category
    - machine nature can be changed
    - animal nature canot be changed
- understanding of categorization in children is limited
  - only have what children can and cannot do at particular ages

### Animal Categorization

- baboons can be taught to classify with high accuracy
  - instrumental conditioning
    - food vs non-food
      - 90% accuracy
    - same vs different
      - ~90% accuracy
- animal categorization may not necessary demonstrate language ability

### Categories Conclusion

- Categorization explains social phenomenon of stereotyping
  - assumes a social group of people share the same characteristics, traits, and behaviors
  - encountering new member of the group will conform to prototype

## Lecture 7

- Expert illusion
- prototyped theory
- basic is the most abstract level at which objects have similar shapes
  - can catergorized stuff a more specific things
    - animals
    - organisms
- superordinate
  - general
- basic level
- subordinate
  - very specific
- catergorizing is a form of human

## Module 9

### Attention

- navigates you through your surroundings
- operational definitions are necessary for testing cognitive models
  - Phenomenon -> Model -> Hypothesis
- William James
  - Selection
    - act of attending to an object to select it apart from the unattended objects
- is an active process
- when irrelevant information overwhelms us, we get distracted

### Automatic and Controlled Attention

- Automatic Processes
  - Involuntary "capture"
    - blinking lights, loud noise
  - fast, efficient
- Controlled Processes
  - Conscious attention
  - slow, effortful
- Driving requires some controlled processes
  - Lane Changes
  - Change Speed
  - Conversations
  - Radio Tuning
- additional resources are limited and must be controlled carefully
  - turning down radio when conversing
  - otherwise everything suffers
    - potentially crash
- Salient information automatically captures our attention
- Consciously effortful tasks can become automatic through practice

### Spotlight Method

- conscious visual attention focuses like a spotlight
- objects within spotlight
  - preferred
  - faster reaction time
  - higher accuracy
- example
  - two boxes that potentially show "\*"
  - when a box flashes, we react faster when \* shows up in that box
  - if \* appears in other box, we react slower
    - appears to show attention shifts faster than our eyes
- attention doesn't immediately rely on sight
  - once difference is spotted, we can't see two photos as same anymore

### Filter Model

- we use auditory cues to filter target sounds from background noise
- cocktail party effect
  - two messages played from same speaker
  - shadowing task
    - repeat one message
  - depends on gender, direction, pitch, speed
- Spotlights enhance the stimulus, wheras filters suppress the noise
  - Information -> filter -> further processing
- we ignore background noise
- Broadbent
  - **Single Filter Model**
  - Single Filter Model of attention is based on the physical characteristics of stimuli
    - Sensory information that doesn't pass this filter is eliminated, and won't be further processed
  - Dichotic Listening Experiment
    - Shadow intended message
      - repeat it out loud
      - answer questions about it
    - unable to process any information from unintended ear
      - changing languages
      - playing message backwards
- Von Right (and colleagues)
  - classical condition a word with electric shock
  - Dichotic Listening Experiment
    - when similar sound/meaning to conditioned word in intended or unintended ear
      - conditioned response
    - suggests some sound/meaning passes through filter
- Breakthrough
  - Participants remember unattended information
  - especially highly relevant information
    - someone say one's name when they're in another conversation
- Treisman
  - **Dual Filter Model**
    - adds semantic filter for meaningful stimuli after physical filter
    - physical filter adds weights to each stimuli (not necessarily eliminates)
    - semantic filter looks for deeper meaning/relevance in the stimuli
      - discards irrelevant information
  - explains cocktail party and breakthrough
- Broadbent revised his Single Filter Model

### The Stroop Task

- very popular
- pushes our attention skills to the limit
- given words, say out loud the colours of the font
  - the given words are names of colours
  - Congruent
    - "Red" in red font
  - Incongruent
    - "Red" in blue font
- stroop effect
  - performance is much faster for congruent words
  - demonstrates attention is facilitated by stimulus relevance (reading the word)
  - **Proportion Congruent Manipulation**
    - Change the ratio of congruent to incongruent trials
      - higher congruent to incongruent
        - Increase Stroop effect
      - higher incongruent to congruent
        - Decrease Stroop effect
  - high congruency tests bias attention to task-irrelevant information
    - we start using the task-irrelevant information as what we are looking for
      - reading facilitates congruent words
      - reading impedes incongruent words
    - as a result very slow at identifying incongruent words, but very fast at identifying congruent words
  - low congruency tests bias attention to task-relevant information
    - consciously surpress task-irrelevant information
    - as a result, slightly slower at identifying every word
- Stroop task shows that automatic process can be consciously controlled
  - Automatic (word reading)
    - Word reading influences performance even when the word is to be ignored
  - Controlled (identify colours)
    - People can adopt consciously controlled word reading strategies that modulate the Stroop effect

### Visual Search

- model everyday tasks
  - everyday attention
- Set Size
  - number of items to search through
- Set Size Effect
  - Increase in difficulty as set size increases
- Single Feature search tasks are relatively easy
- Colour features really stand out
- Pop-out Effect
  - when the object of a visual search is easily found, regardless of set size
  - easily induced by colour
- Conjunction Searches uses two or more features to create a more difficult search
  - when searching for one feature of the object, other objects with that feature is distracting
- Despite the complexity of features, visual searches everyday is easy
  - due to effects such as **Contextual Cueing**

### Attention Conclusion

- critical role of Attention is often taken for granted
- attention allows us to select and filter specific information from a sea of noise
- attention errors can be annoyances
- chronic attention errors can be a symptom of psychological issues
  - ADHD
  - anxiety
  - insomnia
  - depression
  - OCD

## Lecture 8

- Stop
  - jargon and explain new terms
  - talking fast
- Start
  - mini-review of last week's lecture
  - poll question at the start of the class

### Review

- concepted is represented by a prototypical item which has central tendency
  - new exemplar is classified by its similarity to the prototype

### Attention Lecture

- many things compete for one's attention
- we only pay attention to a limited set of information in the environment
- Alertness Arousal
  - we can select our focus on target in all the objects in the alertness arousal
  - vigilance
- Attention captures a portion of the external world to the internal mind
- Attention is a dialogue between bottom-up and top-down processing
- Focus attention: Participants are told to attend to one stimulus and ignore another
  - informs about process of selection
  - what happens to unattended stimuli
- Divided attention: Participants attend to all stimuli
  - informs about processing limitiations
- cost of not paying attention

## Module 10

### Memory

- complex and serves many functions
- Deese Roediger Mcdermitt (DRM) Paradigm
  - memorize several words
    - given words are bug related
  - try to see if certain words were given to be memorized
    - animal, sky, spider
  - a lot of people mistake a certain word to be in original list
- Commonsense analogies fall short because memory is reconstructive
  - memory doesn't work like files in cabinet/computer
  - memory can change and mutate over time

#### Memory Terminology

- Studying memory requires precise use of terminology
- **Encoding**
  - information when it is first being learned
- **Storage**
  - what information is being stored in the brain and how
- **Retrival**
  - how we access previous experiences and make use of them in the present

---

- Memory experiments usually contain an ecoding phase and retrieval phase
  - Encoding phase
    - Study
    - Group 1
      - bizarre imagery for each word
    - Group 2
      - read silently
  - Storage
    - Retention Interval
  - Retrieval Phase
    - Test
- Retrival Cue
  - any information that can access other information in memory
- Two common ways to test memory
  - free recall
    - try to remember as many items from encoding phase as possible with no additional help
  - recognition
    - try to remember if words presented are from encoding phase
- Precise terminology allows us to convey nuanced ideas about memory

### Multi-Store Model

- much of what we know abuot memory comes from studies on amnesiacs
  - brain damage or other abnormalities
- Patient H.M.
  - removed large portions of Hippocampus on both lobes due to seizures
  - mark reduction in seizure
  - severe amnesia
    - every experience from that surgery was new
    - won't remember stuff like
      - his age
      - his dinner
      - his address
  - normal iq
  - had short term memory for conversations
  - can learn complex new motor skills
    - draw reflections from mirrors
- Multi-Store Model suggests memory has temporary and permanent storage
  - Atkinson and Schiffrin in 1968
  - Short Term and Long Term Memory
  - Stimuli/Input enters Short Term Memory
    - acts like RAM in computers
  - can be transferred into Long Term Memory if properly sufficiently
- Short-term memory storage has a capacity of 7+/-2 items
- Organizing items into meaningful chunks expands capacity of short-term memory
  - acrynoms, words, chess formations
  - Chunking
- Models of memory can be tested through simple but clever experiments
  - how well it explains current findings

#### Testing Multi-Store Model

- Given a list of words to remember
- Memory is strongest for items at the beginning and end of a list
  - Serial Position Curve
- Primacy Effect
  - Increased rehearsal of early items over later ones
- Recency Effect
  - Encoded Information is stored in Short Term Memory
  - after 7+/-2 words are stored, each subsequent word replaces the oldest word in short term memory
    - oldest word is placed into Long Term memory
- Increasing presentation time between items affect primacy effect
  - Increasing time between item presentations
    - amount of times each item can be repeated
    - probability of item being stored in long term memory
    - performance recalling first few items on the list
- Disrupting short-term memory buffer affects the Recency Effect
  - perform a filler task immediately after encoding phase
  - can be tested with 2 other groups
    - control group
    - recall after 30s silent interval
  - only filler task resulted in worse performace of last few words
    - silent interval doesn't wipe short term memory
- multi-store model is still foundational to the field of memory
  - boundary between short term and long term memory can be fuzzy

### General Principles of Memory

- Information is encoded at different levelse of processing
  - Shallow level
    - encodes physical characteristics
    - encoding requires little effort
    - poor memory performance
  - Deeper level
    - encodes semantic characteristics
    - encoding requires significant effort
    - better memory performance
- experiment
  - Craik and Lockhart made participants remember a word
    - first group memorized physical attributes
      - is the word in capital letters
    - second group memorized acoustic attributes
      - does the word rhyme with fog
    - third group memorized semantic attributes
      - how does this word fit into a sentence
  - suprised recall test was given after
    - best result is third group and worst result is first group
- criticism
  - hard to scale tests from a single word to complex learning tasks
    - "deep" encoding is ambiguous when it comes to studying a course
  - doesn't pinpoint why one particular study strategy is worse than another
    - only that better memorizing techniques are "deeper" than others
- Levels of Processing Principle
  - the more we try to organize and understanding the material, the better we remember it

#### Environmental Cues

- encoded together with memories for items and events
  - remembering the setting for first kiss
  - encoding specificity
    - using environmental cues to influence recalling memory
    - recalling the context of the memory to help recall the main point
- preserving encoding context improves subsequent recall of a memory
  - being in the same environment when trying to recall a memory may help with the retrieval process
- experiment
  - Godden and Baddeley asked scuba divers to remember a list of words on land and in water
    - when asked to recall the words, having the same environmental context as the encoding phase had a better performance than mismatched ones.
  - Studying after smoking marijuana, one would recall better if they are put under marijuana again.
  - Hermann Ebbinghaus did a self test
    - memorized random gibberish word
      - each gibberish acted as an encoding context for the next and previous word
        - similar to a pearl necklace

---

- Researchers are still searching for general laws of memory

### Forgetting

- what determines whether information is remembered or forgotten
- ability to recall recently encoded information decreases rapidly over time
  - Ebbinghause tested himself
    - best recall right after encoding
    - exponentially decrease until zero
      - negatively accelerating
- **Decay** models suggest that forgetting occurs based on the passive flow of time
  - especially relevant to short term memory
- **Interference** suggests inability to recall information due to similar information fighting for attention
  - competition between the similar sources of information for retrieval
  - explains why people forget details about certain games when they play more and sit out less
    - each game is more similar so they interfere with one another
- Forgetting should be viewed as a loss of access rather than passive decay
  - forgotten memory is really just rendered inaccessible unless very specific cues given

### Memory Illusions and Fluency

- memories are prone to error
- our susceptibility to false memories indicate that memory is a reconstructive process
- experiment
  - Loftus interviewed people about childhood memories, where one of them is fake
    - First day, everyone identified the false memory
    - Third day, 20% of people remembered the false memory as a real one
- common experiences are more likely to be falsely remembered than uncommon ones
  - however uncommon experiences can also be falsely remembered
- Memory is reconstructive and constantly open to re-interpretation
  - retelling a story may have some details swapped out
- we experience familiarity in many occasions
  - seeing a familiar face and not knowing who it is can be because of
    - friend/family
    - celebrity
    - genuine mistake
- Fluency
  - The ease with which an experience is processed, some experiences are easier (more fluent) than others
- Attribution
  - Judgement tying together causes with effect
    - make an attribution of familiarity with a stranger on a bus with the reasons above
      - can also be because they are unconventional, unusual
- Becoming Famous Overnight
  - participants are required to pronounce list of generic names out loud
    - one group then immediately identified a second list of names by how famous they are
      - correctly identify everyone as famous or not famous
    - second group waited 24 hours before doing the same task
      - mistook the names in first list as more famous than new generic names
      - the names in the first list has more processing fluency, so more likely that they may be famous
- act of remembering is reconstructive
  - can fail and lead to false memory
  - mesh and combine different memories when given the right context

### Memory Conclusion

- memory is a large collection of building blocks assembled by preception and experience
- each event is multiple building blocks
  - stimuli
  - internal state
  - external state
- recalling may have issues due to
  - blocks are not accessible (forgotten)
  - blocks are wrongly assembled (false memory)
- memory is an inference
- understanding how memory is processed can improve our memory performance

## Lecture 9

- Attention is the gateway to memory
- processes have to select certain stuff to focus on
- encoding specificity
  - context where encoding occurs means a lot
  - you encode the environment around the memory
    - passively encoded
- Building a better lineup for eyewitness confirmation of a suspect
  - non-suspects should fit the eyewitness' description of the suspect
- encoding interacts with attention to select items for memory
  - converted for storage
- storage doesn't have upper limit
- recalling relevant information used in social environment
- Attention
- Deeper level processing
  - encoding semantic of the information
  - more effort, more robust
  - semantic cues retrieved
