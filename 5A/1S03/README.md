### Wood

- gated by natural resource
- moved to coal
  - less gated at the beginning

### Coal

- 200 tons every 3/4 seconds

- moved to oil

### Oil

- 230 barrels per second
  - on top of coal
- more energy per pound

### The Environmental Movement

- 1962: Silent Spring
  - brought environmental issues to the general
  - Highlight connection to nature, rather than a dominance over nature
