## Week 7 - Communication

### What is Communication
- process by which information is exchanged between a sender and a reciever
- **Interpersonal** communication happens between people 
- Simpliest interpersonal communication is between two people ðŸ‘«

#### Model of Communication Process
![](Week7/CommunicationProcessModel.PNG)
- The model points out the complexities of the communication process and demonstrates the number of points where errors can occur.
- Effective communication occurs when:
    - the **right people** recieve
    - the **right information**
    - in a **timely manner**
- violating these three conditions results in ineffective communication

#### Chain of commands
- lines of authority and formal reporting relationships in an organization
- three forms of communication:
    - Downward communication
    - Upward communication
    - Horizontal communication
- Often ineffective due to:
    - Informal communication: Grapevine
    - Filtering: Important information can be left out
    - Slowness

#### Voice
- Voice is the **constructive expresson of disagreement** or concern about work unit or organizational practices
- involves "Speaking Up" and is contrasted with "Silence" which is witholding relevant information
- form of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)

#### Psychological Safety
- Shared belief that social risk is safe to take
- a positive climate for voice can contribute to psychological safety
- self-censorship will create a climate of silence

#### Jargon
- specialized language used by members of organizations to communicate with one another.
- Can be a efficient means to communicating within peers

BUT
- Can be a status symbol when mastered
- Jargon can also be a barrier between department's communications

### Non-verbal Language of work
- Body Language
- Probs, artifacts and costumes
- Beyond "words" said: **Paralanguage**

#### Body Language 
- Communicate by means of sender's bodily motion and facial expression or
- the physical location of the sender in relation to the reciever
##### Positive Body Language
- Position physically close
- Touch the reciever
- Maintain eye contact
- Lean forward
- Body is facing the reciever

#### Paralanguage

![](Week7/Paralanguage.PNG)


### Computer Mediated Language
- **Information Richness** refers to the potential information carrying of a communication medium
- Two key elements are:
    - degree that the information are synchronous
    - degree that both parties recieve non verbal and paralanguage

![](Week7/InformationRichness.PNG)

- Less **routine communication** requires **richer communication** media (more important decisions)

#### Basic Principles of Effective Communication

- Say what you feel
- Listen actively

## Week 9 - Leadership

### What is Leadership
- All about influence
- Strong influence on an organization's stategy, success and survival

#### Formal vs. Informal Leader
- Formal Leadership
    - Those with titles such as *manager*, *executives*, *supervisor*
    - Expected to influence others, and given authority for employees
    
    BUT
    - Some people fail to influence anybody
    - Leadership goes beyond formal rule requirements

- Informal Leadership
    - Those that emerge from individuals 
    - no formal authority
    - relies on being well liked or being precieved as high skilled to influence others

### Trait Theory of Leadership
- Leadership depends on personal traits of individuals
- those who become great leaders have set of traits that makes them stand out among the mass

##### Limitations to Trait Theory
- not the best means of understanding and improving leadership
- Traits are not sufficients
- Traits are only a precondition for actions that must be taken
- **Behavior** have a greater impact on leadership effectiveness

### Ohio State Leadership Study
- most systematic study of leadership
- two behaviors (independent dimensions):
    - Consideration
    - Initiating Structure

#### Consideration
- approachability, and shows empathy and respect for employees
- Friendly and egalitarian

#### Initiating Structure
- Degree to which group goal attainment is concentrated
- clearly defines and organizes each person's roles and schedules the work to be done

#### Consequences
- Both contribute positively to employee's motivation, job satisfaction, and leader effectiveness
- Consideration is more related to follower satisfaction, motivation, and leader effectiveness
- Initiating stucture is slightly more strongly related to leader job and group performance

#### Leader Reward and Punishment
- Great Jackass Fallacy
    - Humans are more than just mules
    - If left alone, they will want to follow leadership.
    - Can create more opportunities if allowed to have more voice

- A leader's behavior to change their reward and punishment is positively related to employee's perceptions, attitudes and behavior

### Situational Theories of Leadership
- **Situation** - the setting
- effectiveness of a leadership style is dependent on the setting.
- two known theories of leadership is
    - Fiedler's Contingency Theory
    - House's Path-Goal Theory

#### Fiedler's Contingency Theory
- Association between **leadership orientation** and **effectiveness** is *contingent on* the extent to which the *situation is favourable* for exerting influence
- Leadership Orientation
    - how does a leader describe their Least Preferred Co-Worker (LPC)
        - favourably = relationship oriented
        - unfavourably = task oriented
    - Least Preferred Co-Worker is a current/past co-worker that the leader have difficulties with.

##### Situational Favourableness
- which LPC orientation should contribute most to group effectiveness
- Factors that affect situational favourableness:
    - Leader-member relations (most important)
    - Task structure
    - Position Power (least important)

![](Week9/Fiedler.PNG)

#### Path-Goal Theory
- Concerned with which leadership behavior is the most effective under which situations
- A leader's most important activity is to clarify the path to various goals of interest to employees and organizations.

Leadership Behaviors
- Directive behavior
- Supportive behavior
- Participative behavior
- Achievement-oriented behavior

Situational Factors
- effectiveness of each set of behaviors is dependent on the situations that the leader encounters:
    - Employee characteristics
    - Work environment factors
- Leaders tailor behaviors to needs, abilities and personalities of individual employees
- Effective Leaders take advantage of the motivating and satisfying aspects of jobs while
- offsetting or compensating those job aspects that demotivate or dissatisfy

![](Week9/PathGoal.PNG)

##### Participative Leadership
- much research shows that opportunity to participate in work-related decisions increaases job satisfaction, task performance and organizational citizenship behaviour
- partly due to employee empowerment and trust in supervisor
- most workers prefer participative work environment

### Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) Theory
- Effective leadership processes occur when leaders and employees develop and maintain high-quality social exchange relationships.
- basis of LMX is social exchange theory and norm of reciprocity
- LMX reflects degree of
    - mutual support
    - trust
    - loyalty
    - open communication
    - respect between leader and employee
- Employees with higher quality LMX have higher
    - self-efficacy
    - positive work attitudes
    - OCB and job performance
- Higher quality LMX results in positive outcomes for leaders, employees, work units and organizations

### Transactional vs. Transformational Leadership
- **Transactional leadership** - based on straighforward exchange between leader and followers
    - Transactional behaviors involve:
        - Contingent reward
        - Management by exception
- **Transformational leadership** - providing a vision that instills true commitment, changing beliefs and attitudes and motivating to achieve performance beyond expectations
    - usually also good at transactional leadership
    - key dimensions of transformational leader behaviors (4 I's) 
        - Intellectual stimulation
        - Individualized consideration
        - Inspirational motivation
        - Idealized Influence (Charisma)

Intellectual Simulation
- Ability to think about problems, issues, and stategies in new ways
- leader challenges assumptions, takes risks and solicits follower's ideas
- involves creativity and novelty

Individualized Consideration
- treating employees as distinct individuals
- serves as mentor or coach when appropriate
- emphasis on one-on-one to discuss concerns and needs of individuals

Inspirational Motivation
- Communication of visions that are appealing and inspiring to followers
- Strong vision for the future based on values and ideals
- stimulate enthusiasm, challenge followers with high standards, communicate optimism about future goal attainment and provide meaning for task at hand

Idealized Influence (Charisma)
- **most important aspect**
- Leader is a role model
- Inspires loyalty and devotion from followers
- Followers trust, identify with and internalize the values and goals of the leader
- emotional aspect of transformational leadership

#### Research Evidence
- strongly related to
    - follower motivation and satisfaction
    - leader performance and effectiveness and
    - individual, group and organization performance
- especially effective during times of change and obtaining employees' commitment to change
- Best leaders are both transformational and transactional
