### What is a Control System
- simplest form - output provided for a given input
![](Day1/control_system.PNG)
- unity feedback - input 1 output 1

#### Why Need?
- power amplification
- remote control
- convenience on input
- compensation for disturbances - i.e slope of ball, air, door opening
- improve system speed, accuracy, repeatability, performances

### System Configurations

#### Open-Loop System

![](Day1/open_loop_system.PNG)
- open loop control (cheap, not robust)
- no way of knowing if expected output is actual output
- sensitive to disturbances and hard to control

#### Closed-Loop System

![](Day1/closed_loop_system.PNG)
- allows you to check output
- measuring the output response of a system and comparing it to a reference turns open loop system into closed loop

### Transient and Steady-State Response

![](Day1/transient_steady_state_response.PNG)
_transient = in transition_
- transient response tradeoff
	- if you get where you want really fast (high gain)
	- oscillates around point and doesn't settle
	![](Day1/high_gain.PNG)
	- low gain: doesn't overshoot
```	
Percent overshoot = a/b * 100%
a = x-axis to highest point
b = x-axis to lowest point
```

#### Stability Intro

```
Total response = Natural response + Forced response
```

- Natural response (homogeneous) - evolution of system due to initial conditions
- Forced response (particular soln) - Evolution of system due to input
- bounded input doesn't create bounded output :dizzy_face:
- system has to be stable

#### Control Objectives
1. Stabilize the system
2. Produce desired transient response
3. Decrease/eliminate steady state error
4. Make system robust to withstand disturbances and variations in parameters
5. Achieve optimal performance

## Day 2 Jan 5 2018

### Lab 1 and PID Controller
- 70% of problems can be solved with PID
- In Lab 1, you design a PID controller to control position of a DC electric motor's shaft. Criteria for the controller's step response are
	- settling time less than 0.04s
	- overshoot less than 16%
	- system is free of steady-state error

#### Proportional Control System 
- calculating controlled output to make motor go proportionally faster
- open loop version: apply step voltage to motor
   - through feedback, you can put more energy into the system cranking up the gain enough so that it doesn't go unstable or start to oscillate
- makes things go faster by feeding error signal directly to plant

#### Integral Control System
- feeds integral of error to plant
- keeps the motor moving in theory
- however, not always how it works in practicality therefore, a step voltage doesnt mean anything
- therefore you need to integrate over time so the voltage becomes big
- integral gain gets rid of steady state error

#### Derivative Control System
- feeds derivative of error to plant
- prevents overshoot or gets desired amount of overshoot
- later we will learn the theory to predict the control of systems
- in practice, requires a lot of tweeking and fine tuning 
- improves performance of system

#### Underdamped Response Specifications
c<sub>final</sub> = lim<sub>t->inf</sub>c(t)

**c(t)** is the output

1. **Rise time** is the time for output to go from 10% (0.1c<sub>final</sub>) to 90% (0.9c<sub>final</sub>)
2. **Peak time** - time required to reach first and largest peak
3. **Percent overshoot** - %OS percentage that output overshoots final value

%OS = ((c<sub>max</sub> - c<sub>final</sub>)/c<sub>final</sub>)*100%

4. **Settling time** - is it close enough to do whatever we have to do? (settles within +-2% ofc<sub>final</sub>

#### PID Controller
- transfer function of proportional integral derivative controller

![](Day2/PID.PNG)

- first term is proportional, second integral.. etc
- system has 2 zeros plus a pole at origin

#### Block Diagram Representation of System
- can use differential equations to represent relationship between input r(t) and output c(t) or a block diagram of subsystems

### Laplace Transforms and Table
- modelling in the frequency domain entails laplace transforms
- can do by hand or using MatLab
- helps us understand dynamic behaviour of processes
- time domain vs laplace domain (s-domain)
- laplace is best used for stability analysis, controller design, block diagrams)
- **Laplace Transform** - going from time domain differential equation to laplace algebraic equation 
- **Inverse Laplace transform** - algebraic equation to time domain solution

**_Definition_**

![](Day2/laplace.PNG)
- s = σ + jω is th Laplace transform variable
- no information for time less than zero so we multiply f(t) by u(t) 
- but its ok if you write L(1/s^2) = t

#### Laplace Table

![](Day2/laplace_transforms.PNG)

#### Important properties of laplace
- linearity - can bring constants out
- differentiation: limit as t goes to zero
	- laplace of derivative is s*F(s) - f(0-)
- frequency shifting: if you multiply by exponential e<sup>-at</sup> and take laplace, you replace F(s) by F(s+a)

#### Laplace Transform Theorems

![](Day2/transform_theorems.PNG)
- #11 could have poles on left side and maybe one at origin but if it doesnt it violates condition and is unstable

### Transfer Function
- the box in the middle that transforms input
- n<sup>th</sup> order LTI differential equation is of the form:
	![](Day2/LTI.PNG)
- c(t) is output, r(t) is input, G(S) = C(s)/R(s)

#### Example
```
Tp*dc(t)/dt + c(t) = kp*r(t)
------take laplace-----------------
L(Tp*dc(t)/dt + c(t)) = L(kp*r(t))
-------linearity---------------------
Tp*L(dc(t)/dt) + L(c(t)) = kp*L(r(t))
--------differentiation----------------
Tp*(s*C(s) - c(0)) + L(c(t)) = kp*L(r(t))
------apply laplace, assume c(0) = 0----
Tp*s*C(s) + C(s) = kp*R(s)

--------find G(S)-----------------------
G(s) = C(s)/R(s) = kp/(Tp*s + 1)
```

#### Inverse laplace transform
	- ![](Day2/inverse_laplace.PNG)

#### Partial Fraction Expansion
- since the system model will most likely of the form F(s) = N(s)/D(s)
   ```
		s^2 + 2s - 3		       			
	F(s) = ----------------
		s^5 + s^4 - s - 1	   	   

		= s^2 + 2s - 3
		  -----------------
		(s-1)(s+1)^2(s^2+1)

		= A      B       C        Ds + E
		----- + ----- + ----- +  -------
		s-1     s+1    (s+1)^2   s^2 + 1
	```
   - expect a bunch of dif terms
   - pole zero cancellayion, when both denom and numerator have same pole
   - so when you expand the term with s - 1 wont be there

## Day 3 Jan 9, 2018

### Laplace and PartFrac Examples

![](Day3/written1.PNG)

- Final Value Theorem is a quick way to look at the system in the long run
- we know the above is a first order system therefore there are no oscillations

#### Partial Fraction Expansion
- take transfer function and decompose it to compare to the table
- refer to [Cover Up Method](#cover-up-method)

![](Day3/written2.PNG)

### Some MatLab Commands
- define F
- define ```syms s, t```, etc
- ```ilaplace``` - computes laplace
- ```partfrac(F)``` - gets partial fractions
- ```pretty(x)``` - makes it pretty

#### Partial Fractions Decomposition
1. Divide if improper, degree of numerator is denominator
	- do long division
2. Factor denominator
3. Linear factors
	- if you have (s+a)<sup>m</sup>, include A/(s+a) ... A<sub>m</sub>/(s+a)<sup>m</sup>
4. Quadratic factors
5. Determine unknowns

#### Cover Up Method
- neat lil trick for the bois back home
- say you're solving for A
	- look at its denominator and find its pole
	- then cover up that denominator from original
	- sub in the value of the pole and answer shall be A :information_desk_person:

## Day 4 Jan 11, 2018

### Stability Analysis
- if you have a complex polynomial N(s) and D(s)
- after expansion, we refer to roots of D(s) as poles
- if you have some polynomial in matlab, you can do roots([a b c]) with the coefficients of your polynomial ax^2 + bx + c
- ```s = tf('s')``` - makes it so that s is the variable in transfer function
- can find poles of G(s), a transfer function, by doing the above command and ```pole(G)```
- if you have distinct poles p1, p2, p3 then you end up with A<sub>1</sub>e<sup>-p<sub>1</sub>t</sup> + A<sub>2</sub>e<sup>-p<sub>2</sub>t</sup> + ... A<sub>n</sub>e<sup>-p<sub>n</sub>t</sup>
- between G(s) = 1/(s+1) and 1/(s-1), the second one is unstable as it comes to a finite value

#### Real and Imaginary Roots
If we have poles at s = -p<sub>i</sub> = - σ<sub>i</sub> +- jω<sub>i</sub>
- if ω<sub>i</sub> = 0 then pole is strictly real 
- if σ<sub>i</sub> > 0, then pole is in left side of imaginary plane and response decreasess to zero over time - system is **stable**
- if ω<sub>i</sub> = 0 and σ<sub>i</sub> < 0 then pole is in right side of imaginary plane, response increases over time and system is **unstable**
- sometimes you want an oscillation, can tune a system so poles are on imaginary axis
- if only pure imaginary roots, technically considered stable - called **marginally stable** because its impulse response doesn't blow up - σ<sub>i</sub> = 0 and ω<sub>i</sub> != 0
	- this system has no damping

##### Example of Marginally Stable
- poles at -3 and +3 on j (imaginary) axis with G(s) = 1/(s<sup>2</sup> + 9)
- system will blow up with a repeating periodic impulse input
- bounded input to break system: hit it with oscillation of 3 rad/s

#### Complex Roots
Again, if we have poles at s = - σ<sub>i</sub> +- jω<sub>i</sub>
- if ω<sub>i</sub> and σ<sub>i</sub> both != 0 we have complex roots

```
Unstable Example
G = 1/((s-2 +j*3)*(s-2-j*3))

>> impulse(G)
>> step(G)

starts oscillating a lot and doesn't plateau

----------
Stable Example
G = 1/((s+2 +j*3)*(s+2-j*3))

>> impulse(G)
>> step(G)

some oscillation, then plateaus out
```

#### Time Functions associated with s-plane
![](Day4/timefunctions.PNG)
- in theory, turning up the gain and spending infinite energy will make system respone large
- on s-plane, things on j plane appear in complex conjugates

### Impedence, Electric Network Transfer Function, and Circuits
- impedence is laplace generalization of resistance
- need Ohm's law: ```v(t) = Ri(t)```
	- Laplace ```V(s) = R!(s)```
- impledence: ```Z(s) = V(s)/I(s) = R```
- admittance: ```Y(s) = !(s)/V(s) = 1/R = G```

#### Impedence of Inductor
- voltage-current relation of inductor
- ```v(t) = L di(t)/dt```
- assume 0 condition when performing Laplace to find transfer function
- given this cicruit, replace L by Ls
- ![](Day4/circuit.PNG)

#### Impedence of Capacitor
- 1/C*S

#### Summary of Circuit Elements
- things with very low voltage signal use active components - eg cellphone
- active components inject energy unlike passive componenets (without internal energy source)

![](Day4/summary.PNG)

#### Equivalent Resistance and Impedence
- resistance in serial can be replaced by equivalent resistor R<sub>s</sub> = R<sub>1</sub> + .. + R<sub>N</sub>
- same with impedence: Z<sub>s</sub> = Z<sub>1</sub> + .. + Z<sub>N</sub>
- in parallel resistors are R<sub>p</sub><sup>-1</sup> = R<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup> + .. + R<sub>N</sub><sup>-1</sup>
- same with imepedence: Z<sub>s</sub><sup>-1</sup> = Z<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup> + .. + Z<sub>N</sub><sup>-1</sup>

## Day 5 Jan 12, 2018

### Kirchhoff's Current and Voltage Law

#### Current Law
- point of connection between 2 or more circuit elements is referred to as **node**
- current flows into node considered positive, leaving the negative node
- _KCL_ says that the algebraid sum of currents entering any node is 0
- 5 going in, i going in, -3 going out and -2 going out gives a sum of 0
- ![](Day5/KCL.PNG)

#### Voltage Law
- algebraic sum of voltages around closed loop/path is zero
- to find voltage across op resistor, we're going from plus to minus so subtract, therefore it's 3 V
- ![](Day5/KVL.PNG)

#### Written Example
- finding transfer function V<sub>c</sub>(s)/V(s)
- voltage across capacitor varies with integral of v so c becomes 1/cs
- current = the voltages (in series) + Ls + Lr + 1/Cs
- voltage = current * impedence

![](Day5/example.PNG)

![](Day5/written_example1.PNG)

### Mesh Analysis
- if you know the currents in the circuit then you can figure out anything else because current * impedence
- if you know the voltages, same thing because you can do voltage/impedence

#### Mesh Example
 ![](Day5/mesh_1.PNG)

 ![](Day5/mesh_2.PNG)

### Cramer's Rule
- if Ax = B is a system of N linear equations and you wanna solve for N unknowns such that det(A) != 0, then system has unique solution and you can solve for x
- replace column of A<sub>n</sub> by column of B 

![](Day5/cramers.PNG)

- brute force mechanical way of solving matrix
- probably won't have to do a matrix bigger than 3x3
- might wanna put formulars on cheat sheet 

**2 pages of notes allowed on midterm**

### Nodal Analysis
- alternative to mesh analysis
- start out with circuit
- replace elements with their laplace equivalent
- L -> Ls, C -> Cs, etc
- use kirchhoff's current law for equations for unknown voltages

#### Nodal example

![](Day5/nodal.PNG)

## Day 6 Jan 16, 2018

***Midterm during week before reading week\***

### Operational Amplifiers
- resistors, conductors - passive elements that don't put energy into system
- you don't get as much out of these systems
- if you want large gain in system, you need to amplify with _active_ components
- following characteristics
	1. v0(t) = A(v2(t) - v1(t))
	2. high input impedence Zi = infinity
	3. low output impedence Z0 = 0
	4. the more current you draw, still basically same voltage: high constant gain A = infinity
- ideal Op Amp assumptions
![](Day6/ideal_opamp.PNG)
	- input voltages are equal: v1(t) = v2(t)
	- no current flows into inputs i+ = i- = 0

#### Inverting Op Amps
- 2 marks for writing down voltage - voltage at ground = 0, V1(x) = 0
	- current flowing in is 0
	- relation between i1 and i2: i1 = - i2
	- if A is very large gain, force of the two voltages is equal in example below
	- since v1 is approx 0, value of current i1 = (input - 0)/zi
	- i2 = (Vout/z2)
	- This gives the transfer function - V0(s)/Vi(s) = -Z2(s)/Z(s)
	- should write down this configuration on your cheat sheet

	![](Day6/opamps.PNG)

#### Example
Find transfer function Vo(s)/Vi(s) of the following:

![](Day6/opamps_example.PNG)

- Vo(s)/Vi(s) = -Z2(s)/Z1(s), both of which we need to determine 
- using parallel inductance, Z1(s)<sup>-1</sup> = C<sub>1</sub>s + R1<sup>-1</sup>
- Z1(s) = inverse of above
- using serial inductance rule, Z2(s) = R2 + C<sub>2</sub>s<sup>-1</sup>
- through substitution we can now find the transfer function
- multiplying input by s implies derivative
- division by s corresponds to integral
- putting those 3 terms together gives you PID controller
- Gc(s) = K3(s^ + K1s/K3 + K2/K3)/s (as seen earlier)

#### Noninverting Op Amp
- want input to go into positive terminal (unlike previous example)
- we know that Vo(s) = A(Vi(s)-V1(s))

- voltage divider circuit

![](Day6/voltage_divider.PNG)

**written example**

### Mechanical Systems and their Components
- once in laplace form, we just know transfer function
- there are 2 types of mechanical systems, **translational** and **rotational**

#### Mass Component
- we wish to find transfer function Z<sub>m</sub>(s) = F(s)/X(s)
- Newton's second law of motion ```{sum} f = ma```
- laplace forms for position f(t) = Ma(t) is F(s) = Ms<sup>2</sup>X(s)
- if you know position, multiply by s to get velocity **(assignment q)**

#### Viscous Damper
- the things that adds friction to doors so they don't swing open like crazy
- friction is proportional to velocity
- middle part is typically moving through some liquid
- f(t) = f<sub>v</sub>v(t)
- taking Laplace we get F(s) = f<sub>v</sub>sX(s) -- ratio of force to position

![](Day6/viscous_damper.PNG)

#### Spring Constant
- K
- f(t) = Kx(t)
- in laplace: F(s) = KX(s)
- impedence of that Zm(s) = F(s)/X(s) = K
- F(s) = K/s*V(s)
- the derivative/velocity is then K/s

#### Summary of Translational Elements

![](Day6/summary.PNG)

### Translational System
- to find transfer function
	- draw free-body diagram
	- use f = ma to create force equations
	- in example there is force acting to right and force Kx as well as fv*x
	- the m*a component will be left over
	- assume positive direction of travel is to the right
	- Kx and fvx pulling you back

	![](Day6/translational.PNG)

	- b) is laplace form

#### Two degrees of motion
- state space systems, state of a system in the future
- only care about position and velocity
- number of equations of motion = number of linerly independent motions
- in system below, there is a viscous damper between the two masses so they can independently
	- they interact but if one moves the other can remain stable
	- therefore 2 degrees of freedom, one for each mass

	![](Day6/dof.PNG)

- Find transfer function of above by using principle of superposition
- works on linear systems
1. draw free-body diagram of one object by holding the other object still
2. draw free-dbody diagram not olding other object still
3. total force acting on original object is superposition of forces

**M1** 
- nail M2 to the floor
- if M1 moves right, viscous damper pushes you back, spring between gets compressed and spring on left getting stretched AND coefficient of friction AND m*a

![](Day6/m1.PNG)

- a) is fbd if only m1 moves independent of m2
- b) is is m1 when m2 moves
- c) is the superposition of all forces

## Day 7 Jan 18, 2018

### Translational System Example
- find transfer function X(s)/F(s)

![](Day7/written1.PNG)

- moving on to more complex example

![](Day7/written2.PNG)

![](Day7/written3.PNG)

![](Day7/written4.PNG)

## Day 8 Jan 19, 2018

- when asked for transfer function for position from velocity - multiply by 1/s

### Rotational Systems
- x(t) --> θ(t) 
- v(t) --> ω(t) angular velocty
- f(t) --> T(t) torque
- M --> J moment of inertia
	- impedence is Js^2
- fv --> D viscous damper
	- impedence is Ds
- K --> K
	- impedence is K

![](Day8/rotational.PNG)

#### Rotational Degress of Freedom
- which mass you can rotate independently
- in diagram, there are 2 degrees of freedom

![](Day8/dof.PNG)

#### Homework next week
- if you have something that looks like

![](Day8/mass.PNG)
- you have additional degree of freedom. add in mass of size 0

#### Writing Equations of Motion
- use same principle as translational motion
- Consider J1 holding J2 still, consider J1 holding J1 still and add them
- Do the same for J2 and find the sum of torques

## Day 9 Jan 23, 2018

**go back and read slides 65-71**

### Rotational Example
- Find the transfer function θ<sub>2</sub>(S)/T(S)
- flexible rod suported at both ends, undergoing torsion
- system can be approximated by a spring at one point in the rod with inertias J1 and J2
- a) is physical system and b) is schematic

![](Day9/example.PNG)

#### Free body Diagrams for J1
- torues on J1 due to motions of J1 (a)
- torques on J1 due to only motion of J2 (b)
- sum of all torques on J1 (c)
- You get J<sub>1</sub>s<sup>2</sup>θ<sub>1</sub>(s) + D<sub>1</sub>sθ<sub>1</sub>(s) + Kθ<sub>1</sub>(s) = T(s) + Kθ<sub>2</sub>(s)

![](Day9/j1.PNG)

#### Free body Diagrams for J2
- torues on J2 due to motions of J2 (a)
- torques on J2 due to only motion of J1 (b)
- sum of all torques on J2 (c)
- You get J<sub>2</sub>s<sup>2</sup>θ<sub>2</sub>(s) + D<sub>2</sub>sθ<sub>2</sub>(s) + Kθ<sub>2</sub>(s) = Kθ<sub>1</sub>(s)

![](Day9/j2.PNG)

#### Putting it all together
- from the 2 equations, we move the unknowns to the left side and collect terms for θ<sub>1</sub> and θ<sub>2</sub>
- Put this into the form of Ax = B

```
x = [ θ1(s) ]
    [ θ2(s) ]

A = [ J1*s^2 + D1*s + K          -K          ]
    [       -K           J2*s^2 + D2*s + K   ]

B = [ T(s) ]
    [  θ   ]
```

- use Cramer's rule to find 0<sub>2</sub>(s) = |A<sub>2</sub>|/|A|
- thus we get θ<sub>2</sub>(s)/T(S) = |K|/|A|

### Rotational Mechanical System with Gears

![](Day9/gears.PNG)

θ<sub>2</sub>/θ<sub>1</sub> = N<sub>1</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> =
T<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>2</sub>

So T1\*N2 = T2\*N1

```
T1--->[N2/N1]--->T2
```

#### Using Transfer Function for Lossless Gears

Equation of motion is (Js<sup>2</sup> + Ds + K)θ<sub>2</sub>(s) = T<sub>1</sub>(s)(N<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>1</sub>)

- assume negiligable inertia and dampening

![](Day9/transfer_function.PNG)

#### Generalizing Reflecting Impedance

Rule: "Rotational mechanical impedances can be reflected through gear trains by multiplying the mechanical impedence by the ratio (# of teeth of gear on destination shaft/# of teeth of gear on source shaft)^2

#### Examples

![](Day9/written1.PNG)

![](Day9/written2.PNG)

## Day 10 Jan 25, 2018
- Midterm: Feb 8 or 15 5:30 to 7:30

### Electromechanical Transfer Functions and DC Motors

#### DC Motor
- motor that takes a voltage as input and produces a physical displacement as output
- we will derive the transfer function for the armature-controlled dc servomott
- voltage applied -> angular displacement
- it's armature control because you're applying the voltage across the armature

![](Day10/dcmotor.PNG)

##### DC Motor Principles
- they have a comutator
- coil has current flowing up
- need to use handrule to find direction of magnetic force
- F = Bli<sub>a</sub>(t)

##### DC Motor Basics
- contains stationary magentic field provided by permanent or electromagnetic
- motor contains rotating circuit called the armature (the coils) through which current i<sub>a</sub> flows
- there is inductance in the coil

#### Back EMF
- when conductor moves at right angles to magnetic field, it generates voltage at terminals of the conductor (like a generator)
- since armature is rotating in magnetic field is produces voltage proportional to velocity
- vb(t) = Kb*(dθ<sub>m</sub>/dt)
- taking laplace we get V<sub>b</sub> = K<sub>b</sub>sθ<sub>m</sub>(s)

#### Analyzing Armature Ciruit for Transfer Function
- we wish to find θ<sub>m</sub>(s)/E<sub>a</sub>(s)
- torque is proportional to curent
- apply kirchoff's coltage law
- we end up with equation of motion:

```
Tm(s) = (Jm*s^2 + Dms)*θm(s)

*m is subscripted
Dm is viscous damping
Jm is moment of inertia
```

This gives us transfer function K/(s(s+α)).

#### Deriving Jm and Dm
- typical use of motor

![](Day10/motor_use.PNG)

- Ja is moment of inertia, Da is viscous damping
- we can reflect the lad to get armature inertia, gears: desitination/source gear squared

#### Deriving Electrical Constants
- _dynamometer_ measures torque and speed of a motor under constant applied voltage
- previously we derived: (R<sub>a</sub>/K<sub>t</sub>)*T<sub>m</sub>(s) + K<sub>b</sub>sθ<sub>m</sub>(s) = E<sub>a</sub>(s)
- taking the laplace inverse of that we get (R<sub>a</sub>/K<sub>t</sub>)*T<sub>m</sub>(t) + K<sub>b</sub>ω<sub>m</sub>(t) = e<sub>a</sub>(t)
- if we tune our mechanical system we
- stall point is the maximum torque you can get out of the system

In lab we will apply voltage across motor, it will ramp up (like first order system) then go into steady state and run at steady state velocity

### Linear and Nonlinear systems
- linear has 2 properties
	1. Superposition means that the output response to a sum of inputs isequal to the sum of the output response of each individual input that makes up the sum
	2. Homogeneity - s
- non-linear
	- op amps are lnear over given range 
	- sometimes you can do a [linear approximation](#linearization) of non-linear systems

![](Day10/nonlinear.PNG)

#### Linearization
1. Identify non-linear components and write nonlinear
2. Choose small range of input values over which the system behaves approximately linear. This is a _small-signal input_.
3. Write linear differential expression for this range and then apply Laplace tranforms

##### Linearizing a Function
- take first derivitave of function
- evaluate it at given point (pi/2)
- slope becomes -5

## Day 11 Jan 26, 2018

**Midterm Prep**
- 2017 midterm block diagram problem
- the closed loop in a closed loop in a closed loop

### Reduction of Multiple Systems (Slides 3)
- multiple block diagrams that require block diagram algebra to perform reduction

#### Block Diagrams
- there are **summing junctions** that combine 2 or more signals, producing algebraic sum as output
- depending on the signs on the arrows, your output will be summed
- there are also **pickoff points** that break the input signal into multiple copies

![](Day11/summing_junction.PNG)
#### Cascade Form
- one controller flows into the next in sequence
- we will do unity feedback ssytem where plants are in line with the controllers
- in laplace form, cascade is achieved by multiplying all the transfer functions

##### Loading in Cascaded Subsystems
- seen in assignment 1 circuit analysis question
- when you have things in parallel the current changes, can't just compute 2 transfer functions independently and multiply them together

![](Day11/loading.PNG)

#### Parallel Form
- sum together all the gains

![](Day11/parallel.PNG)

#### Feedback Form
- **input transducer** takes input motion from potentiaometer and translates it to voltage
- **output transducer** - most commonly there are systems with negative feedback
- the feedback is the output C(s) going through H(s)
- by substituting E(s) = R(s) +- C(s)H(s) and C(s) = G(s)H(s) we get G<sub>e</sub> = C(s)/R(s) = G(s)/(1 +- G(s)H(s))

![](Day11/feedback.PNG)

#### Moving Blocks to Create Familiar Forms
- because of distribution, the following 2 are equivalent

![](Day11/equivalence.PNG)

##### Reduction via Familiar Forms Example

![](Day11/reduction.PNG)

- cascade G2 and G3
- all the summing junctions can be merged into 1 summing junction
- all H(s) then become parallel so you can sum them
- multiple ways to do it

![](Day11/reduction_solution.PNG)

#### Reduction By Moving Block

1. move G2 to left of pickoff point creating parallel form
2. reduce feedback system (G3, H3)
3. reduce parallel form containing 1/G2(s) and unity
	- the new block will be (1 + 1/G2(s))
4. Taking G1(s) and pushing it past summing junction, replace H2(s)/G1(s)
5. Can also put above and H1(s) in parallel --> they get summed
6. replace with H2(s)/G1(s) + H1(s)

#### Exam 2016 example

![](Day11/written.PNG)

## Day 12 Jan 30, 2018

#### Midterm 
- Feb 8, 5:30-7:20pm at Canadian Martyrs Centre
- 2 pages of double sides notes

### Modelling in the Time Domain
- there are 2 main approaches for modelling and designing control systems
	- so far we have done frequency domain which is only good for SISO
	- the more modern technique is **state space** representation which is in the time domain
	- thid method can also be applied for non-linear systems but that is beyond our scope

#### State Space Representation
- the state equation for an nth order system, a set of n simultaneous, first-order differential equations with n variables
- for linear time invariant systems (second order systems, n=2), single input v(t), there will be 2 equations of the form:

![](Day12/statespace.PNG) 

State equations
- how the system's state evolves
- x_dot = Ax + Bu

Output equations:
-  
- **System variables** - 
- **Linearly dependent** - x should linearly independent and can't be written as a combo of other variables
- **State variables** 
	- minimal amount of info needed to predict into the future
- **State vector**
	- x_transposed 

- **First derivatives** 
	- x_dot = dx/dt = [dx1/dt dx2/dt...]
- **Output vector**
	- y = [y1, y2, y3..yp]
- **input of control vector**
	- 
#### State Space Representation Example
- go around the block and do kirchoffs law
- write the loop equation Lsi/dt + Ri + 1/C integralidt = v(t)
- we want to convert the equation to 2 first order differential equations
- state vairables are q, the charge and i, the current (staying in time domain)

First equation: derivate of q wrt i is the current

Second equation: integral of idt = q
	- we get the d1/dt = -q/LC - Ri/L + v(t)/L

Take the second equation nd multiple by L to get voltage

Now we can write in matrix format
- state ector is qi

The rate of change of q is i

x vector = [dq/dt, di/t]^T
A = [0 1, -1/LC -R/L]^T
z = [q i]^T
B = [0 1/L]T^ 
u = v(t)

Now you can calculat C and D

#### Aplying State Space Representation

- Select the state vector
	- look at the energy storage (capacitors, inductors) in electrical network
	- for mechanical systems, need to know mass (for every mass there are 2 state variables - position and velocity)
	- have to be linearly independent
	- minimum number of state variables must be chosen, this will be the number of state equations
	- it turns out that if we do this in lapace, we end up with nth order transfer function
	- the number needed is usually equal to the number of storage elements in system

#### Electrical Network
Find a state space representaion for the network below with output ir(t) the current through the resistor

1.

#### Mechanical System
- find state space representation for system if the output is x<sub>2</sub>(t)
- use position and velocity of each linearly independent point of motion

- take state variable 
```
x_vector = [x1 v1 x2 v2...]
we want x2, position of second mass

dx/dt = Ax + Bu
y = Cx + Du

D matrix will be equal to 0
C matrix will be [0 0 1 0] because we are picking x2

A matrix = [0 1 0 0 ] 
           [-----   ]
           [0 0 0 1 ]
           [ -----  ]
```

#### Convert Transfer Function to State Space
- be careful of pole 0 cancellation
- can derive state space equation from a transfer function
- assume you're given an nth order differential eqation, y is system output, u is input

##### Example
- say you have G(s) = 2s^3 + 2s^2 + 3s + 4/s^3 + 5s^2 + 6s + 7
- C(s) = Y(s)/U(s) = 2 + b2s^2 + b1s + b3/s^2 + 5s^2 + 6s + 7

- typically we will be asked for controller canonical form

<SLIDE  19>

## Day 13 Feb 1, 2018

- controler form: you take coefficients of denominator and reverse them
- G(s) = s^2 + 7s + 2/s^3+9s^2+26s+24

![](Day13/written1.PNG)

![](Day13/written2.PNG)

## Day 14 Feb 2, 2018

### State Space to Transfer Function Written Example

![](Day14/written.PNG)

Midterm will cover up to chapter 4-5.

### Time Response
- we are gonna try and develop intuition on what properties w need in a system to get what we want
- so we can look at a systme and tell how its gonna behave

#### Poles and Zeroes
- system is infuenced by its poles and zeroes
- consider a transfer function
	- poles are the roots of denominator
	- zroes are roots of numerator
- in general, at poles G(s) = inf. unless the pole is cancelled by a matching zero
- at zeroes, G(s) = 0 unless zero is cancelled by matching pole

#### Poles and Zeroes of First Order System
- forced/steady state response (input) and the natural/homogeneous response (how system behaves with initial conditions)
- for simple system s+2/s+5 and input 1/s
	- in the graph, x represents poles and o represents a zero
	- in matlab, there is a live editor that lets you interleave text and equations (go to insert -> equation)

```
G = y/x
s = tf('s')
```

## Day 15 Feb 6, 2018

#### Evaluating Response Using Poles
<slide 7>

### First Order Systems
- systems without zeroes
- we can find form specifications for this system like:
1. time constant: 1/a
	- the time required for step response to reach 63% of its final value
	- can get a from the initiial slope at time t = 0, the derivative of c(t) is ae<sup>-at</sup>
2. rise time/settling time
	- rise: time it takes to get to 10% to 90%of final value
		- 2.2/a
	- settling: time required to reach 98% of final value
		- 4/a

**board time**

![](Day15/written.PNG)

### Testing to Determine Transfer Function
- often not possible/practical to determine function by analytic means
- in general, gain of system at s = 0 (DC input) is not unity
- more general model is G(s) = K/s+a
- by Final Value Theorem, we get steady state as K/a using partial fractions
- for system to be first order its unit step response should have no overshoot and should have non-zero initial slope
- c(inf) = K/a

### Second Order Systems
- for first order, varying system parameters only changes speed
- second order system is b/(s<sup>2</sup>+as+b)
- these changes can change the form of the system's response
- might see damped oscillation
	- over damped - looks similar to first order but its kinda curvy
		- 2 non-equal real poles
	- pole closest to 0 is the dominant pole
	- under damped - most interesting behaviour
		- complex conjugate poles (non-zero real and imaginry parts)
	- critically damped - 2 equasl real poles response
	```
		 G(s) = 9/(s^2+6s+9)
		      = 9 /(s+3)^2
		C(s) = G(s)/s = 9/(s*(s+3)^2)
		     = A/s + B/(s+3) + C/(s+3)^2
	```
	- undamped - system with 2 imaginary poles (0 zero parts)
		- frequency of osciallations corresponds to imaginary part

#### General Second Order Systems
- we will tpically get the frequency of a system without any dampening
- then we talk baout ratio of dampening, independent of time scale
- takng the transfer function of second orde system, we get the poles
- We can rewrite the system in terms of w<sup>n</sup> and C

## Day 16 Feb 8, 2018

- midterm day
- didn't pay attention but I think it was a review of [Day 17](#day-17)
- also did a lot of matlab stuff

## Day 17 Feb 9, 2018

### Approximation of Higher Order Systems
- approximate them as second-order systems containing dominant polesk
- dominant poles are the 2 poles farthest to the right (typically)
- how far is far enough away? depends on how accurate you want to be
- textbook assumes 5 times further to the left than dominant poles

```
G2nd = .....
[p, z]=pzmap(G2nd) # second order
define p, z, p3
step(G2nd)
G3rd = zpk([],[p(1) p(2) p3],1) # gain = 1

output if you hit this with step (all poles are in left half plane)

z = 0x1 empty double column vector

step(G2nd)
hold
step(G3rd)

```

#### Justification for Ignoring Nondominant Poles
- the further you put them the faster they decay exponentially
- if D is really big then it will have a fast response
- steady state response is unity gain
- if D is big it will have an initial effect
- if we let C go to infinity then D looks like -b

```
C(s) = bc/(s(s^2+as+b)(s+c)) = A/s + (Bs + c)/(s^2+as+b) + D/(s+c)
A = 
B = ca-c^2/
C = (ca^2-c^2a-bs/(c^2+a-ca))
D = -b(c^2+b-ca)
```

#### System Response with Zeros
- if we have zeros, they don't affect order but they affect response
- therefore same denominators
- if zero is far to the left then it lets A get large, it gets much larger than poles

#### Nonminimum Phase System
- as soon as yu give it input, it goes in the opposite direction
- this is when zero is in the right half plane

#### Pole Zero Cancellation
- if you have a zero and it's really close to the pole
- the zero will cancel the pole
- can only be used to cancel things in left half plane with a zero, **NEVER** the right half plane
	- this was asked on the 2016 final

```
C(s) =     26.25(s+4)
       -----------------
      s(s+4.01)(s+5)(s+6)

this is an unstable system

```

#### Analysis and Design of Feedback Systems

```
---> o ---> K ----> 1/(s(+a)) ---->
|				|
|				|
---------------------------------

T(s) =  K/(s(s+a))
     -----------------
      1 + L/(s(s+1))
     =      K
	 -----------
	  (s+a) + K

    =      w_n^2
	---------------
	s^2 + 2 {{zeta(?)S + w_n}

w_n^2 = K
2(zeta)w
```

#### Gain Design for Transient Respone
- design a value for system gain K such that resposne has 10% overshoot
- overshoot formula for zeta

![](Day17/zeta.PNG)

- **matlab script**
```
a = 5
G = zpk([], [0 -a],1)
pos = 10
zeta = formula
Wn = sqrt(K)

rlocus(G)
```

## Day 18 Feb 13, 2018

### Stability
- there will be a question on this on the final

#### Intro
- ways to determien if a system is stable
- if the system is unstable, transient respone and steady state are irrelevant
- all the other criteria don't matter so stability is the first thing you check


#### Stability and Natural Reponse 
- for LTI systems, total resposne of system is c(t) = c<sub>forced</sub>(t) + c<sub>natural</sub>(t)
- stable if natural resposne goes to 0 as t approaches inf
- unstable if it gets unboudned
- marginally stable if natural respone either decays or grows (stays constant or oscillates with fixed amplitude)

#### Bounded Input Bounded Output
- if any bounded input produces an unbounded output (even just one) then the system is unstable
- if every bounded input produces bounded output then it is stable

#### Stability and Poles
- stable if all poles strictly in left half plane (negative exponentials/complex, decaying amplitude)
- unstable if any pole in right hand side
- marginally unstable
	- zeros on -y and +y just generates oscillations and is marginally stable (1/(s^2+w^2))
	- but if you take that and double the poles ie 1/(s^2+w^2)^2 is unstable
- multiplicity 
- poles on imaginry axis with multiplicity of 1 will be untable by the BIBO definition
	- for example if we hve G(s) = 25/((s^2+25)(s+1))
	- u(t) = cos(wt), U(S) = s/(s^2+w^2)
	- C(s) = G(s)U(s) = 25s/((s+1)(s^2+25)^2)
	- matlab simulation: 
	```
	G = 25/(s^3+s^2+25s+25)
	impulse(G*s/(s^2+25))

	# in time domain use elsim, gives same output
	G_theta = 5/(s^2+5s)

	step(G_theta)
	```
	- for BIBO, nothing can be on j omega axis or else that input will be able to mess up the system
	- if you have marginally stable system with poles on j axis, it is not BIBO stable because bounded input (the pole) can blow system up (give bounded input)

#### Example
- gain of 3, unity gain
- gives underdamped system
- poles of the closed loop system strictly in left half plane therefore BIBO
- input that will give biggest oscillation is 1.047

![](Day18/stable.PNG)

- second example is unstable

![](Day18/unstable.PNG)

#### Stability Summary

Real Part of Poles | Natural Response | BIBO
------------------ | ---------------- | ------------
All poles < 0 | stable | stable
any pole > 0 or imaginary poles of multiplicty > 1 | unstable | untable
poles <= 0 and imaginary poles multiplicity of 1 | marginally stable | unstable

#### Closed Loop Systems
- when poles arent where we want we can use feedback control system

##### Necessary Stability Condition
- necessary condition for polynomial to haev all roots in open left hand plane (all positive coefficients)
- not a sufficient condition
- if some coefficients are missing, may be unstable or at best marginally unstable

#### Routh Hurwitz Criterion
- gives stability info without having to find poles of closed loop system
- create a routh table
	1. label rows of table with powers of s down to s^0
	2. list coefficients across top row starting with coefficient of highest power of s
	3. list remaining coefficients in second row starting with coefficeint of second highest power
- fill in the remainder
	- 2x2 determinants
	1. each entry is negative determinant of entries from previous 2 rows
	2. each determinant i divided by the entry in the first column of row above
	
##### Interpresting a Basic Routh Table
- system is stable if there are no sign changes in the first column
- on thursday we're gonna do the routh table for system on slide 15

## Day 19 Feb 15, 2018

### Stability and Routh Tables Example

![](Day19/written1.PNG)

![](Day19/written2.PNG) 

![](Day19/written3.PNG)

## Day 20 Feb 16, 2018

### Routh Table Cases

#### Case I: Zero Only in First Column - Reciprocal
- polynomial whose roots are reciprocal of original polynomial, has poles with same distributions
- if you have a pole at -2, the reciprical is -1/2 which is still in the left half plane

#### Case II: Row of Zeroes
- if we evaluate s<sup>3</sup> row, we find all entries to be 0
- why row of zeros:
	- when purely even or odd polynomial as a factor
	- where all powers of s are even or odd
	- for the T(s) example, no sign changes and 4 imaginary poles, all poles on y axis and it's marginally stable

#### Stability Design via Routh-Hurwitz
- tuning system to make sure it's stable (solved yesterday)
- now we are going to look at it in state space

#### Stability in State Space
- from liear algebra we know sI-A inverse is the adjoint
- using all the equations we have we get det([sI-A]) = D(s)
- roots of det([sI-A]) = 0 will be the eigenvalues of A

Slide set 7

### Steady-State Errors
- difference input and output as t --> infinity

#### Test Inputs
- < add standard test table >
- find out if its accelerating (1/s^2), at constant velocity (1/s) or stationary (1)
- step: pretty simple, going from point A to B
- ramp would be used for vehicles?
	- AIM, autonomous intersection management - vehicle reservation/request system \ - reduce need for deceleration and acceleration since constant velocity
	- intersection managers, communication protocol to make sure cars get through intersection quickly without collision
	- inersection manager calculates trajectory of car in space time (position vs time)
	- vehicle to vehicle communication
- parabola would be for a rocket

#### Steady State Error and Stable Systems
- design system to be stable first and then you can fine tune to have finite error
- there is transiet and forced resposne. for step input you'll get k/s
- two scenarios that you want for step
	1. goes to where you expect (zero error) - approaches exponentially but decays
	2. constant error value

![](Day20/step.PNG)

#### 3 Scenarios for Steady State Error in Ramp Input
1. zero error (converges)
2. constant value error
3. ramp can't keep up with system, infinite error (grows at different angles)

![](Day20/ramp.PNG)

## Day 21 Feb 27, 2018

#### Steady State Error and Block Diagrams
- closed loop TF T(s), what we get from input to the output you do what we want minus what we have
- we are intrested in time domain signal
- reference signal - output of closed loop system

#### Sources of Steady State Error
- for an electric motot you should get 0 error if yo do feedback control (proportional error feedback)
	- in actual, your response gets really close to steady state
- if TF going to 0, you get smaller and smaller error
- if you wanna reduce steady state error, crank up the gain (migth cause overshoot and oscilations)
- if we have K/s, lim as t -> inf as long as K is positive and stable --> 0/(0+K) = 0
- in general, given close loop TF, output C(S) = TF*R(S), error is R(S)[1 - T(S)]
```
e_ss = lim s->0 s*E(s)
     = lim s->0 s*R(S)/(1 + G(s))
	 **assuming stable function

For R(s) = 1/s
e_ss = 1/(a + lim s->0 G(s))
     = the lim s->0 G(s) part is the DC gain for a step input of the forward TF
```

- to have zero steady state error we need the lim of G(s) as s goes to 0 to be infinity
- if you want to track a step you need a pole at the origin

```
For R(s) = 1/s^2
e_ss = 1/(a + lim s->0 G(s))
     = the lim s->0 G(s) part is the DC gain for a ramp input of the forward TF
```

- if you have a 1/s term (intgegrator) you will get a steady state error for n = 0
- same thing for parabolic input and R(S) = 1/s^3
- to get infinity as the limit you need 3 poles at the origin minimum
- if n = 2 and you multiply by s^2 you get the poles???
- if n = 1 you get infinite error
- you cant track a parabola unless you have 1/s^3

### Steady State Error Example

Find steady state inputs for inputs 5u(t), 5tu(t), 5t<sup>2</sup>u(t)
- the forward path (100*(s+2)(s+6))/(s(s+3)(s+4))
- tracks a ramp bc 1/s

![](Day21/written.PNG)

### Static Error Constants
- steady state error performance specs 
1. Position Constant 
	- K<sub>p</sub> = lim<sub>s->0</sub>G(s) 
	- thus e<sub>step</sub>(inf) = 1/(1 + K<sub>p</sub>)
2. Velocity Constant
	- K<sub>v</sub> = lim<sub>s->0</sub>sG(s) 
	- thus e<sub>ramp</sub>(inf) = 1/K<sub>v</sub>
3. Acceleration Constant
	- K<sub>a</sub> = lim<sub>s->0</sub>s<sup>2</sup>G(s) 
	- thus e<sub>para</sub>(inf) = 1/K<sub>a</sub>

#### System Type
- this is what the static error constant is made using, based on number of integrants

#### Steady State Error Summary

![](Day21/summary.PNG)

#### Tight Steady-State Error Specification
- when you gotta be careful but have a lil bit of constant error like a robotic arm

#### Error Specification Example
- find value of K such that there is 10% error steady state
- type of system - Type 1
- K(s+5)/(s(s+6)(s+7)(s+8))
- in response to a ramp for type 1 system you get 1/K<sub>v</sub>

```
want e<sub>ramp</sub>(inf) = 0.1
= 1/Kv

Kv = lim s->0 s*G(s)
   = 5K/(6*7*8)
```

## Day 22 Mar 1, 2018

#### Steady State Error and Disturbances
- using feedback systems to handle unwanted disturbances
- track reference signal with 0 error
- ```E(s) = R(s) - C(s) => C(s) = R(s) - E(s)```
- using final value theorem, e<sub>ss</sub> = e<sub>R</sub>(inf) + e<sub>D</sub>(inf)
- if we set R(s) = 0, then we get ```E(s)/D(s) = G2/(1 + G1G2)```

![](Day22/written1.PNG)

#### Steady State Error and Disturbances

![](Day22/written2.PNG)

#### Continued Example
- Want to track steps at R(s) with 0 error in the presence of non-zero step disturbance input at V(s)
- G(s) is a type 1 system so it trakcs steps R(s) with zero error for C(s) = K
- forward path is type 2
- in this case, closed loop from R(s) to θ(s)

## Day 24 Mar 6, 2018

### Root Locus Techniques
- where closed loop poles are gonna go

#### Control System Problem
- poles of open loop transfer function are typically easy to find and do not depend on gain K
- thus it is easy to determine stability and transient response
- for closed transfer function, need to factor T(s)
- For example G(s) = (s+1)/(s(s+2)) and H(S) - lag compnesator = (s+3)/(s+4)
	- closed loop TF = T(s) = K(s+1)(s+4)/
- root locus gives us an idea of how the poles move around as the gain changes

#### Vector Representation of Complex Numbers
- the rules of root locus and how to compute
- just need to follow the rules
- given any complex number we can represent it in polar coordinates with magnitude M and angle theta
- if F(s) = (s + a) we would get (σ + a) + jω

F(s) = (s+1)/(s(s+2)) at s = -3 + j4

Pole at 0, pole at -2 and 0 at -1.    

![](Day24/written.PNG)
                                                 
```
matlab - atan2   

Try at home
s = tf('s')
F = ..
s1 = evalfr(F, -3+j*4)
M=abs(s1)
theta = angle(s1)

other commands
feedback()
poles()
```

#### Sketching Root Locus
- put this on cheat sheet
1. Number of branches
	- the paths that poles tranverse
	- number of brahces thus equals number of poles
2. symmetry on real axis
	- complex conjugate
3. Real-axis segments
	- for k > 0, root locus oly ecists on the real axis to the left of an off number of infitinte open-lop poles and/or zeros that are also on the real axis
	- angles must add up to multiple of 180
	- for every complex conjugate, the angles cancel each other out
	- just need to draw x's and o's and count odd numbers

4. starting and ending points
	- root locus begins at the finite and infinite poles of G(s)H(s) and ends at the finite and infinite zeros off G(s)H(s)
	- root locus begins at zero gain and for small K, denominator is D_G(s)D_H(s) + epsilon

## Day 25 Mar 8, 2018
- on figure 8.8 you would shade p3
- if you had a PID controller (s + 3s + 4)/s, there's one infinite pole, so there would be a line coming in from infinity
- finite pole goes from 0, to te first zero (-1)
- for this one, if s gets really big, it looks like s^2/s = s which is 1 infinite pole
- number of infinite zeroes as s gets infinitely large is m-n for m > n, for a system (s<sup>m</sup>+a<sub>m-1</sub>s<sup>m-1</sup>...)/(s<sup>n</sup>+b<sub>n-1</sub>s<sup>n-1</sup>...)

G(s) = 1/s

if you have K/(s+1)(s+2) or 2 ininte zeroes, we need 2 ines going to infinity. get one mark sketxhing line between the 2 x's - easy for quadratics

5. Behaviour at Infinity
	- as locus approaches infitinity, it approaches straight lines as asymptotes

#### Real-axis and Break in Points
- the number of poles that come up and meet is 180 or pi divided by the number of poles that are meeting up
- typically will be in pairs
- what value of K does figure 8.13 correspond to at each ends of the x axis?
- K = -1/(G(σ)H(σ))
- if you evaluate that functions at all the numbers on the x-axis line, you will reach a maximum

#### The jω Axis Crossings
- can use Routh Hurwitz criteria

```
syms sigma s K

G = K*(s+3)/(s*(s+1)*(s+2)*(s+4))

eq1=G==-1

// need to et into form K = ___ so we can take a derivative
eq2=isolate(eq1,K)


// take derivative of K and set it to 0, gives you something complex
points=solve(diff(rhs(eq2),1)==0)

// this is more useful
dK=diff(rhs(eq2),1)

simplifyFraction(dK)

// find roots of dK
points=roots([3 26 77 84 24])

G = zpl([-3], [0, -1, -2, -4]) % (s+3)/(s(s+1)(s+2)(s+4))

angle(evalfr(G,points(3)))
ans=0
angle is not an odd multiple of pi so -1.6097 is not a breakin/out point for K > 0. It is actually a breakout point for root locus K < 0.

angle(evalfr(G,points(4)))
= 3.14...

rlocus(G)

syms s K
%symbolic version of transfer function -> G
Gcls = Gs/(1 +k*Gs)

```

## Day 27 Mar 13, 2018
- continuation of matlab script above

```
Routh Table
Gcls =
RT = [s^4 1 14 3*K; s^3 7 K+8 0]

after d=collect(d)

d = s^4 + 7s^3 + 14s^2 + (K+8)s + 3K

subs(d,s,j*omega)

ans = 3K - 14w&2 + w^4 - 7w^3i + w(K+8)i

(solve by substitution using lambda = w^2 and do quadratic formula)
both the real and imaginery parts of the d equation have to equal 0 for the jw to be on the root locus (cloed lop emans denomination is zero ...)

soln(2)
ans = 7sqrt(145)/2 - 65/2

First lets solve for values of jw that make the imaginary part zero -> j[(K+8)w-7w^3]=j0

eval(subs(solve(3K-14*omega^2 + omega^4==0),K,soln(2)))
ans = 3.3881, -3.3881, 1.5877,-1.5877

### Departure Angles
- is it getting closer to getting stable (right) or unstable (left)
- sum of zero sngles - sum of pole angles = (2k+1)180deg

```
            K(s+2)
G(s) = --------------------
        (s+3)(s+1+j)(s+1-j)


angle of G(-1+j + epsilon) e=epsilon
    = angle(-1 + j + e + 2) - angle(-1+j+e+3) - angle(-1+j+e+1+j) - angle(-1+j+e+1-j)

approx = angle(-1+j+2) + angle(-1+j+3) - angle(-1+j+1+j) - angle(-1+j+e+1-j)

last term is the departure angle we are looking for

in order for it to lie on root locus it has to equal (2k+1)*pi

θ1 = θ3 - θ4 - θ2 - (2K+1)pi
```

## Day 28 Mar 15, 2018

### Transient Response Design via Gain Adjustment
1. highr order poles are much farther left (more than 5 times) of the s-plane dominant closed loop poles
2. closed loop zeros near 2 dominant closed loop poles must be nearly cancelled or must be far away from the two dominant poles
- wind up with G_cl = (~~s+z~~)/((~~s+z+eps~~)(...))
3. closed loop zeroes that are not cancelled have to be far away

#### Defining Parameters on Root Locus
- as percent overshoot is a function of the damping ratio, we get a constant number of lines
- previously we showed that settling time is 4/damping ratio*omega_n
- vertica line is a constant settling time
- if we get %OS and damping ratio, you can draw a line and that;s your desired closed loop pole location
- peak time (of overshoot) is pi/(w_n*sqrt(1-zeta^2))
- horizontal lines are consant peak time
- we will either get a peak and settling or OS% and we will get any 2 of those
- need to have all 3 lines intersecting

#### Design Procedure for Higher Order System
1. sketch the root locus (for open loop system)
2. assume system has no zeros and is second-orde. find desired gain that gives desired transient respone
- check that system satisfies criteria t ojustify approximation
4. simulate system to make sure transient response is aceptable
- - if your poles are not far enough to the left then it's not an accurate representaion

#### Example
- given a system, unity feedback system with a zero, closed loop system has zero at 1.5
- open loop poles at 0, -1, -10
- when you do second-order system approximation, the pole at -10 is gonna be higher order (the one we try to ignore)
1. do the x and 0s, colour between so odd number to the right
- as k is cranked up, the leftmost pole goes further and further
 - if we crnk up gain high enough, 
 - in order to figure this out you need to calculate breakin break out points (there are multiple)
	- need to taake derivatives and set polynomial to zero
- in this case 0.8 is the damping ratio coresponding to 1.52 OS%
- there are 3 possible k values (at inteersectio)
- if it intersect at an s value it'll give u k (1/G(s))
- damping ratio thet = 0.8 = arccoss(0.8)
- search along the line to find the s values
- rlocfind does this for you on matlab
- first value plugged in gives k = 7.36

#### Continuing on Matlab

```

OS% = pos = 1.52
zeta = -log(pos/100)/sqrt(pi^2+log(pos/100)^2)
G8_21 = (s+1.5)/(s*(s+1)*(s+10))
rlocus(G8_21)
sgrid(zeta,0)
K = 1/abs(evalfr(G8_21, s,))

[K,p]=rlocfind(G8_21)

compute closed loop system
Gcl= feedback(K*G8_21,1)

----> K ----> G ----->
 ^                |
 |----------------|

step(Gcl)

we can now see transient response

```

once you know the 3 pole locations (dif choices of K = 7.36, 12.79, 39.64) then you can compute peak time and settling time

#### Third Order System Gain Design
- third order system is higer because it has a 0 and acts like a PD controller (which responds quickly when a zero is added to the system)
