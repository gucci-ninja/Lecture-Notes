### Definition of Sustainable Development
- Sustainable Development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs - _Brundtlanf Report_
- concepts of responsibility and ethics
### Triple Bottom Line
- social responsability, environmental impact, financial value

### CSR Corporate Social Responsibility
- form of self-regulation for companies intgrated into business model
- ensures compliance with the spirit of the law, ethical standards and international norms

- ecological footprint - measure of how much nature is needed to support humans
    - carbon footprint
    - land footprint
    - water footprint
- LCA Life Cycle Assessment for environmental impact of product, service or activity
- we use sustainability metrics and indicators to measure degree of sustainability in all 3 areas of triple bottom line
- result of environmental impact can be climate refugees/environmental migrants that must leave their home due to climate change
- goal is to work towards **ecological resilience** - have the ability to recover from disasters

### About Joel Hilchey

## Day 3 Jan 24, 2018

TED Talk on advertising and diamond shreddies :laughing:

**quizzes will be in class component that you will get 15 minutes to do, need notes from group problem-solving**

### Vision for Course
- better understanding of how the worls is interconencted and have responsability for your actions
- clearer idea of how you choose to contribute personally and professionally

### Ethics and Morality in General
- Her Dilemma, Thomas Hardy - intro to ethics
    - dilemma: choice between 2 imperfect options
    - the gurl decided to lie and say she loves a guy who was dying, in a church
    - "De kind wenever possible. It is always possible" - Dalai Lam
- What is the right thing to do?
- **naive realism** - the idea that if someone is different belief than you then you believe theyre stupid, missing information or too lazy to come up with the same conclusion as you
- "Test of first-rate intelligance is the ability to hold 2 opposed idea in the mind and at the same time retain the ability to function" - Scott Fitzgerald

### Trolley Problems
- There is a runaway trolley headed down a track
- 5 people are tied to the track by some mad guy
- you can flip a switch to divert the train but the 1 person tied to other track
- in ethics there are 3 options
    - ethically obligatory to pull the switch
    - ethically forbidden to pull switch
    - ethically permissible (you could do it but don't have to)

#### Trolley and the Fat Man
- runaway trolley headed down a track, 5 people are ties to the track
- you're on a bridge and could drop a fat guy in front of the train to stop it and prevent 5 deaths
- this time you are directly causing a death so less people would push him

#### The Transplant
- You're a genius doctor and 5 of your patients need transplants
- unfortunately no organs are available
- a healthy traveller comes and he has all da organs
- assume that nobody will suspect you if you kill the traveler off

#### Why?
- it matters whether you're directly involved or indirectly
- in the first example the mad scientist puts lives in danger, not you
- platinum rule: all people are different
- does it matter if you know the people?
- does it matter how many people? is there a threshold?

#### Types of Ethics
- meta-ethics
    - how do we understand what's right and wrong?
- normative ethics
    - what should we do to be moral?
- descriptive ethics
    - by hat values do people actually abide by?
- moral psychology
    - how does moral capacity develop, how do we determine morals

#### Ethics Lanuage
- consequentialism - the morality of an action is to be judged on its consequences
- deontology - says the morality of an action is to be judged in and of the action itself
    - opposite of consequentialism
- stakeholders - who has something to gain or lose from this?
- utilitarianism - the greatest good for the greatest number of people
- moral involvement - degree to which someone is involved in moral dillema
- moral obigation - do you have any sort of duties/respondabilities to people
- values - a person's principles or stansards of behaviur, judgement of whats important in life
- intentinoal harm - acting with the will to hurt another. Measuring immorality of decision is a form of deontolgical ethics
- rights - moral legal entitlements
- categorical imperative - unconditional moral obligation

##### Things to Abide By
It's not blac and white always
undertand the options
follow you own moral compass (or the one given to you as an engineer)

### Group Discussion 2
- Rules for a new ideal society
- Disucss potential rules if we wiped out the law
- Let's say it's an island with 5000 people with the neccesities to live
- What must be done?
    -  democracy
    - learn about ethics
    - respect all life forms
    - share with those in need (people who are sick or too young)
    - there should be a basic income and simpler tax like percentage of income
    - be a contributing member of society
- What is forbidden?
    - killing people
    - violence
    - don't beat your kid
    - hoarding resources
- What is permissible?
    - voting
    - drugs, can do them but don't have to
    - religious beliefs
    - be kind
    - lying
- consider a variety of specifics (drugs, violence, honesty)

- drug legalization vs decriminalization

### Real life examples of Ethics
- Volkwagen Fuel Scandal
- Hazel McCallion Conflict of Interest
    - hidden conflict of interest
- Rob Ford's Conflict of Interest
- Ontario Gas Plant Scandal

#### Ethical Development
- avoid punishment
- follow the rules
- do what is right (engineers don't have to get to this stage)

## Day 4 Jan 31, 2018

### Resilience and Cities

#### Dealing with ethical or moral dillemas
1. look for your biases
2. look at your options from different people's perspectives
3. consider the options and how they affect stakeholders
4. what is important to you

#### Pre-test
1. Explain the usage limits of the earth for renewable and non-renewable resources
2. The global birth rate is  over the past 50 years
    - decreasing fertility rate
3. Who most likely feels the most impact from unsustainable activities? Why?
4. What is jevons paradox

#### Post Carbon Institute
- we need to do 4 things:
1. depend less on fossil fuels
2. stop doubling population
3. don't depend on economic growth
4. deal with our legacy of environmental degredation

#### How We Got Wealthy
- 300 Years of Fossil Fuels in 300 Seconds
- Did we require fossil fuels for our wealth? - not really, GM - "the future is electric"

#### Usage Limits
Explain the concept of sustainable usage limits of the earth
- create different rules for both renewable and non-renewable resources.
- non-renewable: need to use in a continuous, cyclic process for it to be sustainable usage
    - steel does this, except it down-cycles
- sustainable - pertaining to a syste that maintains its own viability by using techniques that allow for continual reuse.
- resilience and sustainability are very linked

#### Broken WIndow Fallacy
- that if a window is broken you'll be creating opportunities for people
- not true since there will be work either way
- prosperity comes from production not destruction

#### Now vs Later
- I = PAT: impact = population\*consumption/person\*impact/person
- what will our impact be in 25 years
- my guess: 300% or 3 times the impact we are having now
- 2016: 7.335 bill - 2041: 8.979 bill (factor 1.22)
- consumption: 3.5% per year, compounded over 25 years
    - (1+i)^n -> factor of 2.36
- so far, 2.88 times the impact
- **jevon's paradox**: as efficiency increases, consumption increases

### Group Discussion 3 for Case Study

**Will have to submit this one and the 2 after this**

You have reently been promoted to the position of SUstainabilty Commissioner for the City of Hamilton. Climate Change has had real and significant impacts on certain aspecs of City Infrastructure operation, and in particular storms with high winds have been experienced on a regular basis and rain is falling frequently during winter months.

The mayor and members of the council have asked you to provide a white paper on what suggestions you have for making Hamilton increasingly resilient to high wind velocity events and ice storms.

- concrete homes, steel reinforcement
- less decoratives --> less flying debris
- underground hideout
- tunnels
- only use materials that pass stress-testing and pressure-testing
- reinforced hot water pipes o 
- less wooden fences

### Cities, Buildings & Design

- Jane Jacobs wrote The Death and Life of Great American Cities
- what makes a great city
    - safe city requires 'eyes on the street'
    - if people use the space, it's safe and interesting
    1. multiple primary use space
        - attract different types of people for different purposes at different times of the day
    2. Short blocks
        - many paths to get from place to place, many visiting options, encourage walking and create feeling of connectedness, access, proximity
    3. diverse ages of buildings
        - dfferent rental rates
        - can have opportunities for small, independent and unique niche businesses and for more established companies
        - enforces mixed use space
    4. sufficiently high population densities
        - large customer base for niche businesses

### Group Discussion 4 for Case Study

The mayor has recently returns from a happy cities tour in South America and wants to make Hamilton the recognized Canadian leader in the happy city movement. 

How would you improve Hamilton? What types of things matter?

**Decision Making** 
- Stakeholder identiciation
- formulation of design problem
- identification/development of criteria
- formulation of alternatives 
- refinement
- selection
- stakeholder feedback & public information sessions at many stages
- making a recommendation to decision maker

**Relevant story**

The internet of things is progressing. As objects become equipped with their own IP addresses, it is possible, for example, that your toaster, hot water tank, and alarm clock could communicate with each other and have a hot shower ready for you when you wake up, and toast ready for you when u hop out of the shower. Suppose this "internet of things" were implemented on a household basis. List 12 potential unintended consequences (at least 6 of them negative) of this technology, including economic, social/cultural, health, and ecosystem integrity.
