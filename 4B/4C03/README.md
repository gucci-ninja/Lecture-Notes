### What is the Internet
- billions of connected computing devices
    - hosts running network apps
- communication links
    - fiber
    - copper
    - radio
    - satellite
- packet switches
    - forward packets of data
    - routers
    - switches
- internet = network of networks
    - interconnected ISPs
- protocols for sending/receiving msgs
    - TCP
    - IP
    - HTTP
- internet standards
    - RPC
    - IETF
    - IEEE
    - more strict because physical constraints are resrictive

#### What is a protocol
- specific messages sent, specific actions taken when messages are received 

#### Network Structure
- client and server, client requests, server provides

#### Read at Home
- access networks
    - DSL cable network
    - shared vs dedicated access
    - DSL is thinner than coaxial
        - coaxial has more bandwidth
    - tv can be transmitted over DSL
- frequency division multiplexing
    - send signals with diff frequency through same wire and they wont's interfere as long as there is a considerable difference between the signal frequencies
