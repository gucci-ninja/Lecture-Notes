# 2E03 Planetary Astronomy

## Day 1 - Jan 6, 2020

### Inventory of the Solar System
- sun -- terrestrial planets --- jovian planets ---- ice giants
- 1 sun
- 4 terrestrial (rocky)
    - Mercury
    - Venus
    - Mars
    - Earth
- 2 jovian (gas giants)
    - Jupiter (roman name for Zeus)
    - Saturn
    - rocky core
- 2 ice giants
    - Uranus
    - Neptune
    - resemble gases in the sun
    - methane, ammonia
- satellites (moons) and ring systems
    - our moon is actually pretty thicc :moon:
    - most planets have moons
- minor bodies
    - dwarf planets eg Pluto, Eris
    - comets (Kuiper belt) - billions of these
    - more comets (oort cloud) - trillions of these
        - creation of jupitr pushed them to the edge of our solar system
- asteroids
    - asteroid belt between terrestrial and jovian planets

#### Satellites
- Jupiter's 4 moons are what Galileo observed
- Titan is the only moon that has an atmosphere
    - 90 degrees K
    - hydrogen cyanide (super dense)

## Day 2 - Jan 8, 2020

### Small Bodies
- comets and asteroids
- inner parts of the solar system where we see asteroids are warmer since they are condensed
- different bodies have different temperatures
- icy bodies are further out in solar system
- leftovers from planet formation
- oceans of earth were prbbly formed in a drier part of the solar system where it cant be condensed into ice

### Relative to Sun
- sun derives its energy from nuclear fusion
- typical stars in our galaxy are smaller than the sun
    - stars arent' always bigger than planets ()
- 99.8% of the mas of solar syste is in the sun
- most abundent element is hydrogen, then helium, then oxygen or carbon?
- Jupiter is 318 earths big
    - the jupiter red eye thing is as big as earth


### Four lil planets
- venus is much hotter than it should be (kinda like me)
- mars
    - in the earlier ages of solar system, jup and sat may have been closer to the lil planets and kinda pushed a lot of the smaller planets
    - that's why mars grew up in really bad conditions

### Tracking planets orbit
- jupiter and mars are easy
- all the planets orbit on the same plane
- pluto's orbit is significantly out of plane
- ecliptic plane
    - contains earths orbit around the sun
    - if you draw the angular momentum vector pointing up, the ecliptic plae is perpendicular
- pluto is a body that has ben perturbed by neptune
- resonance
    - compatibility between the forcing and oscillation period that allows energy to b eeficnently transferred
- gas dust disk from which the planets formed (that's why they have similar orbital plane)

### Heliosphere
- solar wind creates heliosphere
- sun launches eruptions into solar wind
- therefore the solar system is not just empty space
- nececary for planetary atmosphere
- 
### Voyager 1 and 2
- have left the solar system

### Question 1.2
- main physical difference between stars and planets
    - stars produce energy by fusion reactions, planets don't
- stars do produce energy by gravitational contraction
    - jupiter also does this, it puts out 2x the energy it receives
- if you have a body and you shrink it by delta r, you would have to release graviatioal energy that is released as heat
- contraction => graviationl potential energy release => heat => radiates away
- the sun is 1000 Jupiter masses
- sun has 10^8 times the luminosity of jupiter
- minimum mass star you can have to produce heating reaction (hydrogen fusion - when you take 4 Hydrogen to get helium and 2 electrons with positive charge (2e+) and 2 neutrinos (2ve) + 2 gamma ray photons
- M<sub>min,H</sub> ~ 0.075Msun = 80 M<sub>J</sub>
- 2nd fuel (low mass stars)
    - deuterium (heavy water, one proton and one neutron) - D
- D + H ==> He+ + gamma
- minimum mass for deuterium fusion is around 13 M<sub>J</sub>
- so it's 80 Jupiter masses which is greater than the mass of a brown dwarf (baby star) whcih is greater than the mass of 13 jupiter masses 

```
80 Mj >= Mbd >= 13 Mj
```

### Planetary Properties
- sidenote: if you know a stars mass and chemical composition, then you can compute all the properties of the stars (how it evolves)
1. orbit (a - semi-major axis)
2. mass M
3. radius R
4. chemical composition [carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, Fe (iron)..]
5. rotation (horshoe symbol)
6. temperature T
    - largely determined by presence of star unless there is internal heat being producd (jupiter)
7. magnetic field B
8. structure of the planet
9. structure of surface
10. structure of atmosphere

#### How the Properties relate to Exoplanets
- M-a diagram
- M-R diagram
    - given the mass of a panet, we can try to predict the radius
- chemical comp is currently researched
    - useds spectroscopy
- we know a little bit about magnetic fields
- 8,9,10 are hard to measure so we don't know much about this.

## Day 3 - Jan 9, 2020
- shape and velocity of the orbit tells us a lot about planets
- orbits can be circular, eliptic but if they are hperbolic then they are unbound
- hyperbolic systems have higher energy since they are unbound
    - higher escape speed from solar system
- there are planets in interstellar space that have been kicked out of their place

### Notes on Solar System Bodies

#### Mass
- how to we measure a planet's mass?
    - we look at the moons and use kepler's third law
- to use kepler's law for a small body you jus need the mass of one body
- if there are no observable moons, we loo at perturbations
- if it doens't have a circular orbit that means there may be another pkanet perturbing it (tidal/graviational forces)
- we also have voyager missions whose flybys tell us the mass of planets they go by

#### Temperatures
- the radiation from a star (such as the sun) heats the surface of a planet
    - called irrradiation
    - this is how terrestrial planets are heated
- when the earth as formed it was super hot
- the temperature of the surface of earth is a combination of the atmosphere of earth + irradiation
- the surface of Venus temperature is 37 K and eath's is around 288 K
    - caused by CO2 greenhouse effect

#### Atmospheres

. | Composition | Pressure
-----|------|------
Venus | CO2 | 90 bars
Earth | N2 (78%), O2 (21%) | 1 bar
Mars | tenuous CO2 | like standing on peak of Mt Everest
Titan and Pluto | N2 | ??

- it's hard to send a lander to venus because it'll melt and aso be crushed
- the reason VEnus and Earth are different even though they were formed similarly and have similar mass is because there is water on earth
- water allows the calcium carbonate (limestone) on our planet to not be gassified

### Exoplanets
- the first key aspect is the semi major axis which is measured in astronomical units (earth's is 1) - i think it's a distance?
- there are 4000 known planets but still thousands of candidates
- diagram of mass vs semi-major axis has plotted all known planets
- in order to see jupiter we can look at the sun and see its reflection?
    - need to cancel out the light from the sun itself by using some specal technique that shifts the wavelength up and down so they cancel out and you can see jupiter or jupiter-like planets on the sun or stars
- second key aspect of a planet is its radius
    - transit method - block out light or sm??
    - fit he planet has a doppler effect on a star you can get the mass
    - if you take sm with the density of rock and mix it with iron it has a charactersitic density and you'd make an object of certain  size
- a number of planets lie on the 'earth-like' line
    - water worlds which are mostly ocean
- by knowing density (mass and radius) then you can predict the planet;s properties
    - we can come up with a possible structure for the planet
