# 2E03 Planetary Astronomy

## Day 1 - Jan 6, 2020

### Inventory of the Solar System
- sun -- terrestrial planets --- jovian planets ---- ice giants
- 1 sun
- 4 terrestrial (rocky)
    - Mercury
    - Venus
    - Mars
    - Earth
- 2 jovian (gas giants)
    - Jupiter (roman name for Zeus)
    - Saturn
    - rocky core
- 2 ice giants
    - Uranus
    - Neptune
    - resemble gases in the sun
    - methane, ammonia
- satellites (moons) and ring systems
    - our moon is actually pretty thicc :moon:
    - most planets have moons
- minor bodies
    - dwarf planets eg Pluto, Eris
    - comets (Kuiper belt) - billions of these
    - more comets (oort cloud) - trillions of these
        - creation of jupitr pushed them to the edge of our solar system
- asteroids
    - asteroid belt between terrestrial and jovian planets

#### Satellites
- Jupiter's 4 moons are what Galileo observed
- Titan is the only moon that has an atmosphere
    - 90 degrees K
    - hydrogen cyanide (super dense)

## Day 2 - Jan 8, 2020

### Small Bodies
- comets and asteroids
- inner parts of the solar system where we see asteroids are warmer since they are condensed
- different bodies have different temperatures
- icy bodies are further out in solar system
- leftovers from planet formation
- oceans of earth were prbbly formed in a drier part of the solar system where it cant be condensed into ice

### Relative to Sun
- sun derives its energy from nuclear fusion
- typical stars in our galaxy are smaller than the sun
    - stars arent' always bigger than planets ()
- 99.8% of the mas of solar syste is in the sun
- most abundent element is hydrogen, then helium, then oxygen or carbon?
- Jupiter is 318 earths big
    - the jupiter red eye thing is as big as earth


### Four lil planets
- venus is much hotter than it should be (kinda like me)
- mars
    - in the earlier ages of solar system, jup and sat may have been closer to the lil planets and kinda pushed a lot of the smaller planets
    - that's why mars grew up in really bad conditions

### Tracking planets orbit
- jupiter and mars are easy
- all the planets orbit on the same plane
- pluto's orbit is significantly out of plane
- ecliptic plane
    - contains earths orbit around the sun
    - if you draw the angular momentum vector pointing up, the ecliptic plae is perpendicular
- pluto is a body that has ben perturbed by neptune
- resonance
    - compatibility between the forcing and oscillation period that allows energy to b eeficnently transferred
- gas dust disk from which the planets formed (that's why they have similar orbital plane)

### Heliosphere
- solar wind creates heliosphere
- sun launches eruptions into solar wind
- therefore the solar system is not just empty space
- nececary for planetary atmosphere
- 
### Voyager 1 and 2
- have left the solar system

### Question 1.2
- main physical difference between stars and planets
    - stars produce energy by fusion reactions, planets don't
- stars do produce energy by gravitational contraction
    - jupiter also does this, it puts out 2x the energy it receives
- if you have a body and you shrink it by delta r, you would have to release graviatioal energy that is released as heat
- contraction => graviationl potential energy release => heat => radiates away
- the sun is 1000 Jupiter masses
- sun has 10^8 times the luminosity of jupiter
- minimum mass star you can have to produce heating reaction (hydrogen fusion - when you take 4 Hydrogen to get helium and 2 electrons with positive charge (2e+) and 2 neutrinos (2ve) + 2 gamma ray photons
- M<sub>min,H</sub> ~ 0.075Msun = 80 M<sub>J</sub>
- 2nd fuel (low mass stars)
    - deuterium (heavy water, one proton and one neutron) - D
- D + H ==> He+ + gamma
- minimum mass for deuterium fusion is around 13 M<sub>J</sub>
- so it's 80 Jupiter masses which is greater than the mass of a brown dwarf (baby star) whcih is greater than the mass of 13 jupiter masses 

```
80 Mj >= Mbd >= 13 Mj
```

### Planetary Properties
- sidenote: if you know a stars mass and chemical composition, then you can compute all the properties of the stars (how it evolves)
1. orbit (a - semi-major axis)
2. mass M
3. radius R
4. chemical composition [carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, Fe (iron)..]
5. rotation (horshoe symbol)
6. temperature T
    - largely determined by presence of star unless there is internal heat being producd (jupiter)
7. magnetic field B
8. structure of the planet
9. structure of surface
10. structure of atmosphere

#### How the Properties relate to Exoplanets
- M-a diagram
- M-R diagram
    - given the mass of a panet, we can try to predict the radius
- chemical comp is currently researched
    - useds spectroscopy
- we know a little bit about magnetic fields
- 8,9,10 are hard to measure so we don't know much about this.
